      <h2>
        REFLECTIONS ON THE REVOLUTION IN FRANCE
      </h2>

      <h3>IN A LETTER INTENDED TO HAVE BEEN SENT TO A GENTLEMAN IN PARIS</h3>

      <h3>[1790]</h3>

      <p>
        It may not be unnecessary to inform the reader, that the following Reflections had their origin in a correspondence between
the Author and a very young gentleman at Paris, who did him
the honour of desiring his opinion upon the important transactions,
which then, and ever since, have so much occupied the attention of
all men. An answer was written some time in the month of October,
1789; but it was kept back upon prudential considerations. That
letter is alluded to in the beginning of the following sheets. It has
been since forwarded to the person to whom it was addressed. The
reasons for the delay in sending it were assigned in a short letter to the same gentleman. This produced on his part a new and pressing application for the Author's sentiments.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Author began a second and more full discussion on the subject.
This he had some thoughts of publishing early in the last spring; but, the matter gaining upon him, he found that what he
had undertaken not only far exceeded the measure of a letter, but
that its importance required rather a more detailed consideration
than at that time he had any leisure to bestow upon it. However,
having thrown down his first thoughts in the form of a letter, and, indeed, when he sat down to write, having intended it for a
private letter, he found it difficult to change the form of address,
when his sentiments had grown into a greater extent, and had received another direction. A different plan, he is sensible, might be more favourable to a commodious division and distribution of his matter.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dear Sir,
      </p>

      <p>
        You are pleased to call again, and with some earnestness, for my
thoughts on the late proceedings in France. I will not give you
reason to imagine that I think my sentiments of such value as to wish myself to be solicited about them. They are of too little consequence to be very anxiously either communicated or withheld. It was from attention to you, and to you only, that I hesitated at the time when you first desired to receive them. In the first letter I had
the honour to write to you, and which at length I send, I wrote
neither for, nor from, any description of men; nor shall I in this. My errors, if any, are my own. My reputation alone is to answer for them.
      </p>

      <p>
        You see, Sir, by the long letter I have transmitted to you, that though I do most heartily wish that France may be animated by a
spirit of rational liberty, and that I think you bound, in all honest
policy, to provide a permanent body in which that spirit may
reside, and an effectual organ by which it may act, it is my misfortune to entertain great doubts concerning several material points in your late transactions.
      </p>

      <p>
        You imagined, when you wrote last, that I might possibly be
reckoned among the approvers of certain proceedings in France,
from the solemn public seal of sanction they have received from
two clubs of gentlemen in London, called the Constitutional Society,
and the Revolution Society.
      </p>

      <p>
        I certainly have the honour to belong to more clubs than one, in which the constitution of this kingdom, and the principles of the glorious Revolution, are held in high reverence and I reckon myself
among the most forward in my zeal for maintaining that constitution and those principles in their utmost purity and vigour. It is because I do so that I think it necessary for me that there should be no mistake. Those who cultivate the memory of our Revolution,
and those who are attached to the constitution of this kingdom, will take good care how they are involved with persons, who under the pretext of zeal towards the Revolution and constitution too frequently wander from their true principles; and are ready on every
occasion to depart from the firm but cautious and deliberate spirit
which produced the one, and which presides in the other. Before I proceed to answer the more material particulars in your letter, I shall beg leave to give you such information as I have been able to obtain of the two clubs which have thought proper, as bodies, to
interfere in the concerns of France; first assuring you, that I am
not, and that I have never been, a member of either of those societies.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first, calling itself the Constitutional Society, or Society for Constitutional Information, or by some such title, is, I believe, of seven or eight years standing. The institution of this society appears to be of a charitable, and so far of a laudable nature: it was
intended for the circulation, at the expense of the members, of many
books, which few others would be at the expense of buying; and
which might lie on the hands of the booksellers, to the great loss of an useful body of men. Whether the books, so charitably circulated,
were ever as charitably read, is more than I know. Possibly
several of them have been exported to France; and, like goods not
in request here, may with you have found a market. I have heard
much talk of the lights to be drawn from books that are sent from
hence. What improvements they have had in their passage (as it is said some liquors are meliorated by crossing the sea) I cannot tell: but I never heard a man of common judgment, or the least degree
of information, speak a word in praise of the greater part of the
publications circulated by that society; nor have their proceedings
been accounted, except by some of themselves, as of any serious consequence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your National Assembly seems to entertain much the same opinion
that I do of this poor charitable club. As a nation, you reserved
the whole stock of your eloquent acknowledgments for the Revolution
Society; when their fellows in the Constitutional were, in equity, entitled to some share. Since you have selected the Revolution
Society as the great object of your national thanks and praises,
you will think me excusable in making its late conduct the subject
of my observations. The National Assembly of France has given
importance to these gentlemen by adopting them: and they return the favour, by acting as a committee in England for extending the
principles of the National Assembly. Henceforward we must consider
them as a kind of privileged persons; as no inconsiderable members in the diplomatic body. This is one among the revolutions which have given splendour to obscurity, and distinction to undiscerned merit. Until very lately I do not recollect to have heard of this club. I am quite sure that it never occupied a moment of my
thoughts; nor, I believe, those of any person out of their own set. I find, upon inquiry, that on the anniversary of the Revolution in
1688, a club of dissenters, but of what denomination I know not,
have long had the custom of hearing a sermon in one of their churches; and that afterwards they spent the day cheerfully, as other
clubs do, at the tavern. But I never heard that any public measure,
or political system, much less that the merits of the constitution of any foreign nation, had been the subject of a formal proceeding at
their festivals; until, to my inexpressible surprise, I found them in a sort of public capacity, by a congratulatory address, giving an
authoritative sanction to the proceedings of the National Assembly
in France.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the ancient principles and conduct of the club, so far at least as they were declared, I see nothing to which I could take exception.
I think it very probable, that for some purpose, new members may
have entered among them; and that some truly Christian politicians,
who love to dispense benefits, but are careful to conceal the hand
which distributes the dole, may have made them the instruments of
their pious designs. Whatever I may have reason to suspect concerning private management, I shall speak of nothing as of a certainty
but what is public.
      </p>

      <p>
        For one, I should be sorry to be thought, directly or indirectly,
concerned in their proceedings. I certainly take my full share, along
with the rest of the world, in my individual and private capacity, in speculating on what has been done, or is doing, on the public stage, in any place ancient or modern; in the republic of Rome, or the republic of Paris; but having no general apostolical mission, being
a citizen of a particular state, and being bound up, in a considerable degree, by its public will, I should think it at least improper and
irregular for me to open a formal public correspondence with the actual government of a foreign nation, without the express authority
of the government under which I live.
      </p>

      <p>
        I should be still more unwilling to enter into that correspondence
under anything like an equivocal description, which to many, unacquainted
with our usages, might make the address, in which I joined, appear as the act of persons in some sort of corporate capacity,
acknowledged by the laws of this kingdom, and authorized
to speak the sense of some part of it. On account of the ambiguity
and uncertainty of unauthorized general descriptions, and of
the deceit which may be practised under them, and not from mere
formality, the House of Commons would reject the most sneaking
petition for the most trifling object, under that mode of signature
to which you have thrown open the folding doors of your presence
chamber, and have ushered into your National Assembly with as much ceremony and parade, and with as great a bustle of applause,
as if you had been visited by the whole representative majesty of
the whole English nation. If what this society has thought proper
to send forth had been a piece of argument, it would have signified
little whose argument it was. It would be neither the more nor the
less convincing on account of the party it came from. But this is only a vote and resolution. It stands solely on authority; and in this case it is the mere authority of individuals, few of whom appear. Their signatures ought, in my opinion, to have been annexed to
their instrument. The world would then have the means of knowing
how many they are; who they are; and of what value their opinions
may be, from their personal abilities, from their knowledge,
their experience, or their lead and authority in this state. To me,
who am but a plain man, the proceeding looks a little too refined,
and too ingenious; it has too much the air of a political stratagem,
adopted for the sake of giving, under a high-sounding name, an
importance to the public declarations of this club, which, when the matter came to be closely inspected, they did not altogether so well deserve. It is a policy that has very much the complexion of
a fraud.
      </p>

      <p>
        I flatter myself that I love a manly, moral, regulated liberty as well
as any gentleman of that society, be he who he will; and perhaps
I have given as good proofs of my attachment to that cause, in the whole course of my public conduct. I think I envy liberty as little as they do, to any other nation. But I cannot stand forward, and
give praise or blame to anything which relates to human actions,
and human concerns, on a simple view of the object, as it stands
stripped of every relation, in all the nakedness and solitude of metaphysical
abstraction. Circumstances (which with some gentlemen
pass for nothing) give in reality to every political principle its distinguishing colour and discriminating effect. The circumstances
are what render every civil and political scheme beneficial or noxious
to mankind. Abstractedly speaking, government, as well as liberty,
is good; yet could I, in common sense, ten years ago, have felicitated France on her enjoyment of a government (for she then had a government)
without inquiry what the nature of that government was,
or how it was administered? Can I now congratulate the same
nation upon its freedom? Is it because liberty in the abstract may
be classed amongst the blessings of mankind, that I am seriously to
felicitate a mad-man, who has escaped from the protecting restraint and wholesome darkness of his cell, on his restoration to the enjoyment
of light and liberty? Am I to congratulate a highwayman and
murderer, who has broke prison, upon the recovery of his natural
rights? This would be to act over again the scene of the criminals
condemned to the galleys, and their heroic deliverer, the metaphysic
knight of the sorrowful countenance.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I see the spirit of liberty in action, I see a strong principle
at work; and this, for a while, is all I can possibly know of it. The
wild gas, the fixed air, is plainly broke loose: but we ought to suspend our judgment until the first effervescence is a little subsided,
till the liquor is cleared, and until we see something deeper than
the agitation of a troubled and frothy surface. I must be tolerably
sure, before I venture publicly to congratulate men upon a blessing, that they have really received one. Flattery corrupts both the receiver and the giver; and adulation is not of more service to the people than to kings. I should therefore suspend my congratulations
on the new liberty of France, until I was informed how it had
been combined with government; with public force; with the discipline and obedience of armies; with the collection of an effective and well-distributed revenue; with morality and religion; with the solidity of property; with peace and order; with civil and social manners. All these (in their way) are good things too; and, without
them, liberty is not a benefit whilst it lasts, and is not likely to continue
long. The effect of liberty to individuals is that they may do
what they please: we ought to see what it will please them to do, before we risk congratulations, which may be soon turned into complaints. Prudence would dictate this in the case of separate, insulated,
private men; but liberty, when men act in bodies, is power.
Considerate people, before they declare themselves, will observe the
use which is made of power; and particularly of so trying a thing
as new power in new persons, of whose principles, tempers, and
dispositions they have little or no experience, and in situations, where
those who appear the most stirring in the scene may possibly not be
the real movers.
      </p>

      <p>
        All these considerations however were below the transcendental
dignity of the Revolution Society. Whilst I continued in the country,
from whence I had the honour of writing to you, I had but an imperfect
idea of their transactions. On my coming to town, I sent for an account of their proceedings, which had been published by their authority, containing a sermon of Dr. Price, with the Duke de
Rochefaucault's and the Archbishop of Aix's letter, and several other documents annexed. The whole of that publication, with the manifest
design of connecting the affairs of France with those of England,
by drawing us into an imitation of the conduct of the National
Assembly, gave me a considerable degree of uneasiness. The
effect of that conduct upon the power, credit, prosperity, and tranquillity
of France, became every day more evident. The form of
constitution to be settled, for its future polity, became more clear. We are now in a condition to discern, with tolerable exactness, the
true nature of the object held up to our imitation. If the prudence
of reserve and decorum dictates silence in some circumstances, in others prudence of a higher order may justify us in speaking our
thoughts. The beginnings of confusion with us in England are at present feeble enough; but, with you, we have seen an infancy, still more feeble, growing by moments into a strength to heap mountains
upon mountains, and to wage war with heaven itself. Whenever
our neighbour's house is on fire, it cannot be amiss for the engines to play a little on our own. Better to be despised for too anxious apprehensions, than ruined by too confident a security.
      </p>

      <p>
        Solicitous chiefly for the peace of my own country, but by no means unconcerned for yours, I wish to communicate more largely
what was at first intended only for your private satisfaction. I shall
still keep your affairs in my eye, and continue to address myself to you. Indulging myself in the freedom of epistolary intercourse, I beg leave to throw out my thoughts, and express my feelings, just
as they arise in my mind, with very little attention to formal method.
I set out with the proceedings of the Revolution Society; but I shall not confine myself to them. Is it possible I should? It appears
to me as if I were in a great crisis, not of the affairs of France
alone, but of all Europe, perhaps of more than Europe. All circumstances
taken together, the French Revolution is the most astonishing that has hitherto happened in the world. The most wonderful
things are brought about in many instances by means the most absurd and ridiculous; in the most ridiculous modes; and, apparently,
by the most contemptible instruments. Everything seems out of nature in this strange chaos of levity and ferocity, and of all sorts of crimes jumbled together with all sorts of follies. In viewing this monstrous tragi-comic scene, the most opposite passions necessarily
succeed, and sometimes mix with each other in the mind; alternate contempt and indignation; alternate laughter and tears; alternate scorn and horror.
      </p>

      <p>
        It cannot, however, be denied, that to some this strange scene appeared in quite another point of view. Into them it inspired no other sentiments than those of exultation and rapture. They saw nothing
in what has been done in France, but a firm and temperate exertion of freedom; so consistent, on the whole, with morals and with piety
as to make it deserving not only of the secular applause of dashing
Machiavelian politicians, but to render it a fit theme for all the devout effusions of sacred eloquence.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the forenoon of the 4th of November last. Doctor Richard
Price, a non-conforming minister of eminence, preached at the dissenting meeting-house of the Old Jewry, to his club or society, a very extraordinary miscellaneous sermon, in which there are some good moral and religious sentiments, and not ill expressed, mixed up in a sort of porridge of various political opinions and reflections;
but the Revolution in France is the grand ingredient in the cauldron.
I consider the address transmitted by the Revolution Society to the National Assembly, through Earl Stanhope, as originating in the
principles of the sermon, and as a corollary from them. It was moved by the preacher of that discourse. It was passed by those who came reeking from the effect of the sermon, without any censure
or qualification, expressed or implied. If, however, any of the gendemen concerned shall wish to separate the sermon from the
resolution, they know how to acknowledge the one, and to disavow
the other. They may do it: I cannot.
      </p>

      <p>
        For my part, I looked on that sermon as the public declaration of
a man much connected with literary caballers, and intriguing philosophers;
with political theologians, and theological politicians, both
at home and abroad. I know they set him up as a sort of oracle;
because, with the best intentions in the world, he naturally philippizes,
and chants his prophetic song in exact unison with their designs.
      </p>

      <p>
        That sermon is in a strain which I believe has not been heard in
this kingdom, in any of the pulpits which are tolerated or encouraged in it, since the year 1648; when a predecessor of Dr. Price, the Rev. Hugh Peters, made the vault of the king's own chapel at St. James's ring with the honour and privilege of the saints, who, with
the "high praises of God in their mouths, and a two-edged sword in
their hands, were to execute judgment on the heathen and punishments
upon the people; to bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron." Few harangues from the pulpit, except
in the days of your league in France, or in the days of our
solemn league and covenant in England, have ever breathed less of
the spirit of moderation than this lecture in the Old Jewry. Supposing,
however, that something like moderation were visible in
this political sermon; yet politics and the pulpit are terms that have
little agreement. No sound ought to be heard in the church but
the healing voice of Christian charity. The cause of civil liberty
and civil government gains as little as that of religion by this confusion
of duties. Those who quit their proper character, to assume what does not belong to them, are, for the greater part, ignorant both
of the character they leave, and of the character they assume. Wholly
unacquainted with the world in which they are so fond of meddling,
and inexperienced in all its affairs, on which they pronounce with
so much confidence, they have nothing of politics but the passions
they excite. Surely the church is a place where one day's truce ought
to be allowed to the dissensions and animosities of mankind.
      </p>

      <p>
        This pulpit style, revived after so long a discontinuance, had to me the air of novelty, and of a novelty not wholly without danger.
I do not charge this danger equally to every part of the discourse. The hint given to a noble and reverend lay-divine, who is supposed
high in office in one of our universities, and other lay-divines "of
rank and literature," may be proper and seasonable, though somewhat new. If the noble Seekers should find nothing to satisfy their pious fancies in the old staple of the national church, or in all the
rich variety to be found in the well-assorted warehouses of the dissenting congregations. Dr. Price advises them to improve upon nonconformity;
and to set up, each of them, a separate meeting-house
upon his own particular principles. It is somewhat remarkable
that this reverend divine should be so earnest for setting up new
churches, and so perfectly indifferent concerning the doctrine which
may be taught in them. His zeal is of a curious character. It is not for the propagation of his own opinions, but of any opinions.
It is not for the diffusion of truth, but for the spreading of contradiction.
Let the noble teachers but dissent, it is no matter from
whom or from what. This great point once secured, it is taken
for granted their religion will be rational and manly. I doubt
whether religion would reap all the benefits which the calculating
divine computes from this "great company of great preachers." It would certainly be a valuable addition of nondescripts to the ample
collection of known classes, genera and species, which at present
beautify the hortus siccus of dissent. A sermon from a noble duke, or a noble marquis, or a noble earl, or baron bold, would certainly increase and diversify the amusements of this town, which begins
to grow satiated with the uniform round of its vapid dissipations,
I should only stipulate that these new Mess-Johns in robes and coronets
should keep some sort of bounds in the democratic and levelling
principles which are expected from their titled pulpits. The new
evangelists will, I dare say, disappoint the hopes that are conceived
of them. They will not become, literally as well as figuratively,
polemic divines, nor be disposed so to drill their congregations, that they may, as in former blessed times, preach their doctrines to regiments
of dragoons and corps of infantry and artillery. Such arrangements, however favourable to the cause of compulsory freedom,
civil and religious, may not be equally conducive to the national tranquillity.
These few restrictions I hope are no great stretches of
intolerance, no very violent exertions of despotism.
      </p>

      <p>
        But I may say of our preacher, "utinam nugis tota illa dedisset tempora sævitiæ!" — All things in this his fulminating bull are not
of so innoxious a tendency. His doctrines affect our constitution in
its vital parts. He tells the Revolution Society in this political sermon, that his Majesty "is almost the only lawful king in the world,
because the only one who owes his crown to the choice of his people." As to the kings of the world, all of whom (except one)
this archpontiff of the rights of men, with all the plenitude, and
with more than the boldness, of the papal deposing power in its meridian fervour of the twelfth century, puts into one sweeping
clause of ban and anathema, and proclaims usurpers by circles of
longitude and latitude, over the whole globe, it behoves them to consider how they admit into their territories these apostolic missionaries,
who are to tell their subjects they are not lawful kings.
That is their concern. It is ours, as a domestic interest of some
moment, seriously to consider the solidity of the only principle upon
which these gentlemen acknowledge a king of Great Britain to be
entitled to their allegiance.
      </p>

      <p>
        This doctrine, as applied to the prince now on the British throne,
either is nonsense, and therefore neither true nor false, or it affirms a most unfounded, dangerous, illegal, and unconstitutional position.
According to this spiritual doctor of politics, if his Majesty does not owe his crown to the choice of his people, he is no lawful king. Now
nothing can be more untrue than that the crown of this kingdom
is so held by his Majesty. Therefore if you follow their rule, the king of Great Britain, who most certainly does not owe his high
office to any form of popular election, is in no respect better than
the rest of the gang of usurpers, who reign, or rather rob, all over
the face of this our miserable world, without any sort of right or
title to the allegiance of their people. The policy of this general
doctrine, so qualified, is evident enough. The propagators of this
political gospel are in hopes that their abstract principle (their principle
that a popular choice is necessary to the legal existence of the sovereign magistracy) would be overlooked, whilst the king of Great Britain was not affected by it. In the mean time the ears of
their congregations would be gradually habituated to it, as if it were
a first principle admitted without dispute. For the present it would
only operate as a theory, pickled in the preserving juices of pulpit
eloquence, and laid by for future use. Condo et compono quæ mox
depromere possim. By this policy, whilst our government is soothed with a reservation in its favour, to which it has no claim, the security, which it has in common with all governments, so far
as opinion is security, is taken away.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus these politicians proceed, whilst little notice is taken of their doctrines; but when they come to be examined upon the plain
meaning of their words, and the direct tendency of their doctrines,
then equivocations and slippery constructions come into play. When
they say the king owes his crown to the choice of his people, and is therefore the only lawful sovereign in the world, they will perhaps
tell us they mean to say no more than that some of the king's predecessors
have been called to the throne by some sort of choice; and
therefore he owes his crown to the choice of his people. Thus, by a miserable subterfuge, they hope to render their proposition safe, by
rendering it nugatory. They are welcome to the asylum they seek
for their offence, since they take refuge in their folly. For, if you admit this interpretation, how does their idea of election differ from
our idea of inheritance?
      </p>

      <p>
        And how does the settlement of the crown in the Brunswick line derived from James the First come to legalize our monarchy, rather than that of any of the neighbouring countries? At some time or
other, to be sure, all the beginners of dynasties were chosen by those who called them to govern. There is ground enough for the opinion
that all the kingdoms of Europe were, at a remote period, elective,
with more or fewer limitations in the objects of choice. But whatever
kings might have been here, or elsewhere, a thousand years
ago, or in whatever manner the ruling dynasties of England or France may have begun, the king of Great Britain is, at this day,
king by a fixed rule of succession, according to the laws of his country; and whilst the legal conditions of the compact of sovereignty are performed by him, (as they are performed,) he holds his crown in contempt of the choice of the Revolution Society, who
have not a single vote for a king amongst them, either individually
or collectively; though I make no doubt they would soon erect themselves
into an electoral college, if things were ripe to give effect to
their claim. His Majesty's heirs and successors, each in his time and
order, will come to the crown with the same contempt of their choice with which his Majesty has succeeded to that he wears.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whatever may be the success of evasion in explaining away the
gross error of fact, which supposes that his Majesty (though he
holds it in concurrence with the wishes) owes his crown to the
choice of his people, yet nothing can evade their full explicit declaration
concerning the principle of a right in the people to choose;
which right is directly maintained, and tenaciously adhered to. All
the oblique insinuations concerning election bottom in this proposition,
and are referable to it. Lest the foundation of the king's exclusive
legal title should pass for a mere rant of adulatory freedom,
the political divine proceeds dogmatically to assert, that, by the
principles of the Revolution, the people of England have acquired
three fundamental rights, all which, with him, compose one system, and lie together in one short sentence; namely, that we have
acquired a right

        <ol>
          <li>"To choose our own governors."</li>
          <li>"To cashier them for misconduct."</li>
          <li>"To frame a government for ourselves."</li>
        </ol>

        This new, and hitherto unheard-of, bill of rights, though made in the name of the whole people, belongs to those gentlemen and their faction only. The body of the people of England have no share in
it. They utterly disclaim it. They will resist the practical assertion of it with their lives and fortunes. They are bound to do so by the laws of their country, made at the time of that very Revolution
which is appealed to in favour of the fictitious rights claimed by the Society which abuses its name.
      </p>

      <p>
        These gentlemen of the Old Jewry, in all their reasonings on the Revolution of 1688, have a Revolution which happened in England
about forty years before, and the late French Revolution, so much
before their eyes, and in their hearts, that they are constantly confounding all the three together. It is necessary that we should separate
what they confound. We must recall their erring fancies to the
acts of the Revolution which we revere, for the discovery of its true
principles. If the principles of the Revolution of 1688 are anywhere
to be found, it is in the statute called the Declaration of Right. In
that most wise, sober, and considerate declaration, drawn up by
great lawyers and great statesmen, and not by warm and inexperienced
enthusiasts, not one word is said, nor one suggestion made,
of a general right "to choose our own governors; to cashier them for misconduct; and to form a government for ourselves."
      </p>

      <p>
        This Declaration of Right (the act of the 1st of William and
Mary, sess. 2, ch. 2) is the corner-stone of our constitution, as reinforced, explained, improved, and in its fundamental principles for ever settled. It is called "An Act for declaring the rights and liberties
of the subject, and for settling the succession of the crown." You
will observe, that these rights and this succession are declared in one body, and bound indissolubly together.

        A few years after this period, a second opportunity offered for asserting a right of election to the crown. On the prospect of a total failure of issue from King William, and from the Princess, afterwards Queen Anne, the consideration of the settlement of the crown, and of a further security for the liberties of the people, again came
before the legislature. Did they this second time make any provision
for legalizing the crown on the spurious revolution principles
of the Old Jewry? No. They followed the principles which
prevailed in the Declaration of Right; indicating with more precision the persons who were to inherit in the Protestant line. This
act also incorporated, by the same policy, our liberties, and an
hereditary succession in the same act. Instead of a right to choose our own governors, they declared that the succession in that line (the Protestant line drawn from James the First) was absolutely
necessary "for the peace, quiet, and security of the realm," and that
it was equally urgent on them "to maintain a certainty in the succession
thereof, to which the subjects may safely have recourse for
their protection." Both these acts, in which are heard the unerring,
unambiguous oracles of revolution policy, instead of countenancing
the delusive, gipsy predictions of a "right to choose our governors,"
prove to a demonstration how totally adverse the wisdom of the nation was from turning a case of necessity into a rule
of law.

        Unquestionably there was at the Revolution, in the person of
King William, a small and a temporary deviation from the strict order of a regular hereditary succession; but it is against all genuine
principles of jurisprudence to draw a principle from a law made
in a special case, and regarding an individual person. Privilegium non transit in exemplum. If ever there was a time favourable for
establishing the principle, that a king of popular choice was the only
legal king, without all doubt it was at the Revolution. Its not being
done at that time is a proof that the nation was of opinion it ought
not to be done at any time. There is no person so completely ignorant
of our history as not to know, that the majority in parliament of both parties were so little disposed to anything resembling that principle,
that at first they were determined to place the vacant crown,
not on the head of the Prince of Orange, but on that of his wife
Mary, daughter of King James, the eldest born of the issue of that
king, which they acknowledged as undoubtedly his. It would be to repeat a very trite story, to recall to your memory all those circumstances
which demonstrated that their accepting King William was not properly a choice; but to all those who did not wish, in
effect, to recall King James, or to deluge their country in blood, and
again to bring their religion, laws, and liberties into the peril they
had just escaped, it was an act of necessity, in the strictest moral
sense in which necessity can be taken.
