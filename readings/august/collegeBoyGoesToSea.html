          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Years_Before_the_Mast" target="_blank">Two Years Before the Mast</a>
          is a memoir by the American author Richard Henry Dana Jr., published in 1840, having been written after a two-year sea voyage from Boston to California on a merchant ship starting in 1834.
          The term "before the mast" refers to the quarters of the common sailors.
          Dana gives a vivid account of "the life of a common sailor at sea as it really is".
          <em>Two Years Before the Mast</em> was "conceived as a protest and written to improve the lot of the common sailor".
          The literary style provides a concrete description of a seaman's life to serve as a practical guide, and not as an adventure novel.

      <h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
      <h3>Cape Horn — A Visit</h3>

      <p>
        WEDNESDAY, Nov. 5TH. — The weather was fine during
the previous night, and we had a clear view of the Magellan
Clouds, and of the Southern Cross. The Magellan Clouds
consist of three small nebulae in the southern part of the heavens, —
two bright, like the milky-way, and one dark. These are first seen, just above the horizon, soon after crossing the southern tropic.
When off Cape Horn, they are nearly over head. The cross is composed
of four stars in that form, and is said to be the brightest constellation in the heavens.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the first part of this day (Wednesday) the wind was light,
but after noon it came on fresh, and we furled the royals. We still kept the studding-sails out, and the captain said he should go round
with them, if he could. Just before eight o'clock (then about sun-down, in that latitude) the cry of "All hands ahoy!" was sounded
down the fore scuttle and the after hatchway, and hurrying upon
deck, we found a large black cloud rolling on toward us from the
south-west, and blackening the whole heavens. "Here comes Cape
Horn!" said the chief mate; and we had hardly time to haul down
and <span class="tooltip">clew up<span class="tooltiptext">to haul (the lower corners of a square-rig sail) up to the yard by means of the clew lines.</span></span>, before it was upon us. In a few moments, a heavier
sea was raised than I had ever seen before, and as it was directly
ahead, the little brig, which was no better than a bathing machine,
plunged into it, and all the forward part of her was under water;
the sea pouring in through the bow-ports and hawse-hole and over the knightheads, threatening to wash everything overboard. In
the lee scuppers it was up to a man's waist. We sprang aloft and
double reefed the topsails, and furled all the other sails, and made
all snug. But this would not do; the brig was laboring and straining
against the head sea, and the gale was growing worse and worse. At the same time sleet and hail were driving with all fury against
us. We clewed down, and hauled out the reef-tackles again, and close-reefed the fore-topsail, and furled the main, and hove her to on the starboard tack. Here was an end to our fine prospects. We
made up our minds to head winds and cold weather; sent down the
royal yards, and unrove the gear; but all the rest of the top hamper
remained aloft, even to the sky-sail masts and studding-sail booms.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout the night it stormed violently — rain, hail, snow, and
sleet beating upon the vessel — the wind continuing ahead, and the
sea running high. At day-break (about three, A.M.) the deck was
covered with snow. The captain sent up the steward with a glass
of grog to each of the watch; and all the time that we were off the
Cape, grog was given to the morning watch, and to all hands whenever
we reefed topsails. The clouds cleared away at sunrise, and
the wind becoming more fair, we again made sail and stood nearly
up to our course.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thursday, Nov. 6th. It continued more pleasant through the first part of the day, but at night we had the same scene over again. This
time, we did not heave to, as on the night before, but endeavored to beat to windward under close-reefed topsails, balance-reefed trysail,
and fore-topmast staysail. This night it was my turn to steer, or, as
the sailors say, my trick at the helm, for two hours. Inexperienced
as I was, I made out to steer to the satisfaction of the officer, and
neither S--- nor myself gave up our tricks, all the time that we were
off the Cape. This was something to boast of, for it requires a good
deal of skill and watchfulness to steer a vessel close hauled, in a
gale of wind, against a heavy head sea. "Ease her when she pitches,"
is the word; and a little carelessness in letting her ship a heavy sea, might sweep the decks, or knock the masts out of her.
      </p>

      <p>
        Friday, Nov. 7th. Towards morning the wind went down, and
during the whole forenoon we lay tossing about in a dead calm,
and in the midst of a thick fog. The calms here are unlike those in most parts of the world, for there is always a high sea running, and
the periods of calm are so short, that it has no time to go down;
and vessels, being under no command of sails or rudder, lie like
logs upon the water. We were obliged to steady the booms and
yards by guys and braces, and to lash everything well below. We
now found our top hamper of some use, for though it is liable to be
carried away or sprung by the sudden "bringing up" of a vessel when pitching in a chopping sea, yet it is a great help in steadying a
vessel when rolling in a long swell; giving more slowness, ease, and regularity to the motion.
      </p>

      <p>
        The calm of the morning reminds me of a scene which I forgot
to describe at the time of its occurrence, but which I remember from
its being the first time that I had heard the near breathing of whales.
It was on the night that we passed between the Falkland Islands and Staten Land. We had the watch from twelve to four, and coming
upon deck, found the little brig lying perfectly still, surrounded
by a thick fog, and the sea as smooth as though oil had been poured
upon it; yet now and then a long, low swell rolling under its surface,
slightly lifting the vessel, but without breaking the glassy
smoothness of the water. We were surrounded far and near by
shoals of sluggish whales and <span class="tooltip">grampuses<span class="tooltiptext">Any of various dolphins or other toothed whales, such as the orca.</span></span>, which the fog prevented our seeing, rising slowly to the surface, or perhaps lying out at length, heaving out those peculiar lazy, deep, and long-drawn
breathings which give such an impression of supineness and strength.
Some of the watch were asleep, and the others were perfectly still, so that there was nothing to break the illusion, and I stood leaning over the bulwarks, listening to the slow breathings of the mighty
creatures — now one breaking the water just alongside, whose black body I almost fancied that I could see through the fog; and again
another, which I could just hear in the distance — until the low and
regular swell seemed like the heaving of the ocean's mighty bosom
to the sound of its heavy and long-drawn respirations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Towards the evening of this day, (Friday, 7th,) the fog cleared
off, and we had every appearance of a cold blow; and soon after sundown it came on. Again it was a clew up and haul down, reef and furl, until we had got her down to close-reefed topsails, doublereefed
trysail, and reefed forespenser. Snow, hail, and sleet were
driving upon us most of the night, and the sea breaking over the bows and covering the forward part of the little vessel; but as she
would lay her course the captain refused to heave her to.
      </p>

      <p>
        Saturday, Nov. 8th. This day commenced with calm and thick
fog, and ended with hail, snow, a violent wind, and close-reefed
topsails.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sunday, Nov. 9th. To-day the sun rose clear, and continued so until twelve o'clock, when the captain got an observation. This was
very well for Cape Horn, and we thought it a little remarkable that, as we had not had one unpleasant Sunday during the whole voyage,
the only tolerable day here should be a Sunday. We got time to
clear up the steerage and forecastle, and set things to rights, and to overhaul our wet clothes a little. But this did not last very long.
Between five and six — the sun was then nearly three hours high —
the cry of "All starbowlines ahoy!" summoned our watch on deck;
and immediately all hands were called. A true specimen of Cape
Horn was coming upon us. A great cloud of a dark slate color was
driving on us from the south-west; and we did our best to take in
sail (for the light sails had been set during the first part of the day)
before we were in the midst of it. We had got the light sails furled, the courses hauled up, and the topsail reef-tackles hauled out, and
were just mounting the fore-rigging, when the storm struck us. In an instant the sea, which had been comparatively quiet, was running
higher and higher; and it became almost as dark as night. The
hail and sleet were harder than I had yet felt them; seeming almost
to pin us down to the rigging. We were longer taking in sail than
ever before; for the sails were stiff and wet, the ropes and rigging
covered with snow and sleet, and we ourselves cold and nearly
blinded with the violence of the storm. By the time we had got
down upon deck again, the little brig was plunging madly into a tremendous head sea, which at every drive rushed in through the bow-ports and over the bows, and buried all the forward part of
the vessel. At this instant the chief mate, who was standing on the
top of the windlass, at the foot of the spenser mast, called out, "Lay
out there and furl the <span class="tooltip">jib<span class="tooltiptext">a triangular staysail set forward of the forwardmost mast.</span></span>!" This was no agreeable or safe duty, yet
it must be done. An old Swede, (the best sailor on board,) who belonged on the forecastle, sprang out upon the bowsprit. Another
one must go: I was near the mate, and sprang forward, threw the downhaul over the windlass, and jumped between the knight-heads
out upon the bowsprit. The crew stood abaft the windlass and
hauled the jib down while we got out upon the weather side of the
jib-boom, our feet on the foot-ropes, holding on by the spar, the
great jib flying off to leeward and slatting so as almost to throw us
off of the boom. For some time we could do nothing but hold on, and the vessel diving into two huge seas, one after the other, plunged
us twice into the water up to our chins. We hardly knew whether we were on or off; when coming up, dripping from the water, we
were raised high into the air. John (that was the sailor's name)
thought the boom would go, every moment, and called out to the mate to keep the vessel off, and haul down the stay-sail; but the fury
of the wind and the breaking of the seas against the bows defied every attempt to make ourselves heard, and we were obliged to do
the best we could in our situation. Fortunately, no other seas so heavy struck her, and we succeeded in furling the jib "after a fashion;" and, coming in over the staysail nettings, were not a little pleased to find that all was snug, and the watch gone below; for we
were soaked through, and it was very cold. The weather continued
nearly the same through the night.
      </p>

      <p>
        Monday, Nov. 10th. During a part of this day we were hove to, but the rest of the time were driving on, under close-reefed sails, with a heavy sea, a strong gale, and frequent squalls of hail and
snow.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tuesday, Nov. 11th. The same.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wednesday. The same.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thursday. The same.
      </p>

      <p>
        We had now got hardened to Cape weather, the vessel was under
reduced sail, and everything secured on deck and below, so that we
had little to do but to steer and to stand our watch. Our clothes were all wet through, and the only change was from wet to more
wet. It was in vain to think of reading or working below, for we
were too tired, the hatchways were closed down, and everything was wet and uncomfortable, black and dirty, heaving and pitching.
We had only to come below when the watch was out, wring out our wet clothes, hang them up, and turn in and sleep as soundly as we
could, until the watch was called again. A sailor can sleep anywhere — no sound of wind, water, wood or iron can keep him awake — and we were always fast asleep when three blows on the hatchway,
and the unwelcome cry of "All starbowlines ahoy! Eight bells there below! do you hear the news?" (the usual formula of calling the watch,) roused us up from our berths upon the cold, wet decks. The only time when we could be said to take any pleasure was at night and morning, when we were allowed a tin pot full of hot tea,
(or, as the sailors significantly call it "water bewitched,") sweetened
with molasses. This, bad as it was, was still warm and comforting,
and, together with our sea biscuit and cold salt beef, made quite a meal. Yet even this meal was attended with some uncertainty. We
had to go ourselves to the galley and take our kid of beef and tin pots of tea, and run the risk of losing them before we could get
below. Many a kid of beef have I seen rolling in the <span class="tooltip">scuppers<span class="tooltiptext">a hole in a ship's side to carry water overboard from the deck.</span></span>, and
the bearer lying at his length on the decks. I remember an English
lad who was always the life of the crew, but whom we afterwards
lost overboard, standing for nearly ten minutes at the galley, with
his pot of tea in his hand, waiting for a chance to get down into the forecastle; and seeing what he thought was a "smooth spell,"
started to go forward. He had just got to the end of the windlass,
when a great sea broke over the bows, and for a moment I saw
nothing of him but his head and shoulders; and at the next instant,
being taken off his legs, he was carried aft with the sea, until her
stern lifting up and sending the water forward, he was left high
and dry at the side of the long-boat, still holding on to his tin pot,
which had now nothing in it but salt water. But nothing could ever daunt him, or overcome, for a moment, his habitual good humor.
Regaining his legs, and shaking his fist at the man at the wheel,
he rolled below, saying, as he passed, "A man's no sailor, if he can't take a joke." The ducking was not the worst of such an affair, for,
as there was an allowance of tea, you could get no more from the
galley; and though the sailors would never suffer a man to go
without, but would always turn in a little from their own pots to
fill up his, yet this was at best but dividing the loss among all hands.
      </p>

      <p>
        Something of the same kind befell me a few days after. The cook
had just made for us a mess of hot "scouse" — that is, biscuit pounded fine, salt beef cut into small pieces, and a few potatoes, boiled up together and seasoned with pepper. This was a rare treat, and I, being the last at the galley, had it put in my charge to carry down for the mess. I got along very well as far as the hatchway,
and was just getting down the steps, when a heavy sea, lifting the
stern out of water, and passing forward, dropping it down again,
threw the steps from their place, and I came down into the steerage a little faster than I meant to, with the kid on top of me, and the whole precious mess scattered over the floor. Whatever your feelings
may be, you must make a joke of everything at sea; and if you were to fall from aloft and be caught in the belly of a sail, and thus saved from instant death, it would not do to look at all disturbed, or
to make a serious matter of it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Friday, Nov. 14th. We were now well to the westward of the
Cape, and were changing our course to the northward as much as we
dared, since the strong south-west winds, which prevailed then, carried us in towards Patagonia. At two, P. M., we saw a sail on our
larboard beam, and at four we made it out to be a large ship steering our course, under single-reefed topsails. We at that time had shaken
the reefs out of our topsails, as the wind was lighter, and set the main top-gallant sail. As soon as our captain saw what sail she was
under, he set the fore top-gallant sail and flying jib; and the old whaler — for such, his boats and short sail showed him to be—felt a
little ashamed, and shook the reefs out of his topsails, but could do no more, for he had sent down his top-gallant masts off the Cape.
He ran down for us, and answered our hail as the whale-ship, New
England, of Poughkeepsie, one hundred and twenty days from New
York. Our captain gave our name, and added ninety-two days from
Boston. They then had a little conversation about longitude, in which they found that they could not agree. The ship fell astern,
and continued in sight during the night. Toward morning, the wind
having become light, we crossed our royal and skysail yards, and at daylight, we were seen under a cloud of sail, having royals and skysails
fore and aft. The "spouter," as the sailors call a whaleman, had
sent out his main top-gallant mast and set the sail, and made
signal for us to heave to. About half-past seven their whale-boat came alongside, and Captain Job Terry sprang on board, a man
known in every port and by every vessel in the Pacific ocean. "Don't
you know Job Terry? I thought everybody knew Job Terry," said a <span class="tooltip">green-hand<span class="tooltiptext">a novice</span></span>, who came in the boat, to me, when I asked him about
his captain. He was indeed a singular man. He was six feet high, wore thick cowhide boots, and brown coat and trowsers, and, except
a sun-burnt complexion, had not the slightest appearance of a sailor; yet he had been forty years in the whale trade, and, as he said himself, had owned ships, built ships, and sailed ships. His boat's crew
were a pretty raw set, just set out of the bush, and, as the sailor's phrase is, "hadn't got the hayseed out of their hair." Captain Terry
convinced our captain that our reckoning was a little out, and, having
spent the day on board, put off in his boat at sunset for his ship,
which was now six or eight miles astern. He began a "yarn" when
he came aboard, which lasted, with but little intermission, for four
hours. It was all about himself, and the Peruvian government, and
the Dublin frigate, and Lord James Townshend, and President
Jackson, and the ship Ann M'Kim of Baltimore. It would probably
never have come to an end, had not a good breeze sprung up, which
sent him off to his own vessel. One of the lads who came in his
boat, a thoroughly countrified-looking fellow, seemed to care very
little about the vessel, rigging, or anything else, but went round
looking at the live stock, and leaned over the pig-sty, and said he
wished he was back again tending his father's pigs.
      </p>

      <p>
        At eight o'clock we altered our course to the northward, bound
for Juan Fernandez.
      </p>

      <p>
        This day we saw the last of the albatrosses, which had been our companions a great part of the time off the Cape. I had been interested in the bird from descriptions which I had read of it, and
was not at all disappointed. We caught one or two with a baited
hook which we floated astern upon a shingle. Their long, flapping
wings, long legs, and large staring eyes, give them a very peculiar appearance.
They look well on the wing; but one of the finest sights
that I have ever seen, was an albatross asleep upon the water, during
a calm, off Cape Horn, when a heavy sea was running. There being no breeze, the surface of the water was unbroken, but a long, heavy
swell was rolling, and we saw the fellow, all white, directly ahead of
us, asleep upon the waves, with his head under his wing; now rising on the top of a huge billow, and then falling slowly until he was
lost in the hollow between. He was undisturbed for some time, until the noise of our bows, gradually approaching, roused him, when,
lifting his head, he stared upon us for a moment, and then spread
his wide wings and took his flight.
