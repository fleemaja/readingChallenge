          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Dialogues_between_Hylas_and_Philonous" target="_blank">Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous</a>
           , or simply <em>Three Dialogues</em>, is a 1713 book on metaphysics
           and idealism written by George Berkeley. Taking the form of a dialogue,
           the book was written as a response to the criticism Berkeley
           experienced after publishing <em>A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge.</em>
           Berkeley's views are represented by Philonous (Greek: "lover of mind"),
           while Hylas (Greek: "matter") embodies the Irish thinker's opponents,
           in particular John Locke. In The First Dialogue, Hylas expresses his
           disdain for skepticism, adding that he has heard Philonous to have
           "maintained the most extravagant opinion... namely, that there is no
           such thing as material substance in the world." Philonous argues that
           it is actually Hylas who is the skeptic and that he can prove it.
           Thus, a philosophical battle of wit begins. Philonous questions Hylas
           systematically regarding what humans know of the world, first
           examining secondary qualities, such as heat, to show that such
           qualities do not exist outside the individual mind. He then moves
           on to primary qualities such as extension and shape, and likewise
           argues that they, too, are dependent entirely on one's perception
           (e.g., From a distance, a great mountain appears to be small, and
           the shape of a thing may change dramatically under a microscope).
           The philosophy presented is often misinterpreted. The criticism is that
           Berkeley claims that we live in an illusory world, when in fact, Berkeley
           advocates for the acceptance of ideas as real "things." When we refer
           to an object, we don't refer to a material form, but to the idea of the
           object that informs our senses. Berkeley doesn't propose that nothing
           is real; he proposes that ideas themselves compose reality.

      <h2>THE FIRST DIALOGUE</h2>

      <p>
        <em>Philonous</em>. Good morrow, Hylas: I did not expect to find you abroad so early.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Hylas</em>. It is indeed something unusual; but my thoughts were so taken up with a subject I was discoursing of last night, that
finding I could not sleep, I resolved to rise and take a turn in the
garden.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> It happened well, to let you see what innocent and agreeable
pleasures you lose every morning. Can there be a pleasanter time of
the day, or a more delightful season of the year? That purple sky,
those wild but sweet notes of birds, the fragrant bloom upon the
trees and flowers, the gentle influence of the rising sun, these and a thousand nameless beauties of nature inspire the soul with secret
transports; its faculties too being at this time fresh and lively, are fit
for those meditations, which the solitude of a garden and tranquillity
of the morning naturally dispose us to. But I am afraid I
interrupt your thoughts: for you seemed very intent on something.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> It is true, I was, and shall be obliged to you if you will permit
me to go on in the same vein; not that I would by any means deprive
myself of your company, for my thoughts always flow more
easily in conversation with a friend, than when I am alone: but my
request is, that you would suffer me to impart my reflexions to you.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> With all my heart, it is what I should have requested myself
if you had not prevented me.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> I was considering the odd fate of those men who have in all
ages, through an affectation of being distinguished from the vulgar, or some unaccountable turn of thought, pretended either to believe
nothing at all, or to believe the most extravagant things in the world.
This however might be borne, if their paradoxes and scepticism
did not draw after them some consequences of general disadvantage
to mankind. But the mischief lieth here; that when men of less
leisure see them who are supposed to have spent their whole time in the pursuits of knowledge professing an entire ignorance of all
things, or advancing such notions as are repugnant to plain and
commonly received principles, they will be tempted to entertain suspicions concerning the most important truths, which they had
hitherto held sacred and unquestionable.
      </p>

      <p>
        <p><em>Phil.</em> I entirely agree with you, as to the ill tendency of the
affected doubts of some philsophers, and fantastical conceits of
others. I am even so far gone of late in this way of thinking, that I have quitted several of the sublime notions I had got in their schools
for vulgar opinions. And I give it you on my word; since this revolt from metaphysical notions to the plain dictates of nature and common sense, I find my understanding strangely enlightened, so that
I can now easily comprehend a great many things which before were all mystery and riddle.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> I am glad to find there was nothing in the accounts I heard of you.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> Pray, what were those?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> You were represented, in last night's conversation, as one who maintained the most extravagant opinion that ever entered into the mind of man, to wit, that there is no such thing as material substance in the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> That there is no such thing as what Philosophers call material
substance, I am seriously persuaded: but, if I were made to see anything absurd or sceptical in this, I should then have the same reason
to renounce this that I imagine I have now to reject the contrary
opinion.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> What! can anything be more fantastical, more repugnant to Common Sense, or a more manifest piece of Scepticism, than to believe there is no such thing as matter?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> Softly, good Hylas. What if it should prove that you, who
hold there is, are, by virtue of that opinion, a greater sceptic, and maintain more paradoxes and repugnances to Common Sense, than
I who believe no such thing?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> You may as soon persuade me, the part is greater than the
whole, as that, in order to avoid absurdity and Scepticism, I should
ever be obliged to give up my opinion in this point.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> Well then, are you content to admit that opinion for true,
which upon examination shall appear most agreeable to Common
Sense, and remote from Scepticism?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> With all my heart. Since you are for raising disputes about
the plainest things in nature, I am content for once to hear what you
have to say.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> Pray, Hylas, what do you mean by a sceptic?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> I mean what all men mean — one that doubts of everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> He then who entertains no doubts concerning some particular
        point, with regard to that point cannot be thought a sceptic.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> I agree with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> Whether doth doubting consist in embracing the affirmative or negative side of a question?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> In neither; for whoever understands English cannot but
        know that doubting signifies a suspense between both.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> He then that denies any point, can no more be said to doubt
        of it, than he who affirmeth it with the same degree of assurance.
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> True.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> And, consequently, for such his denial is no more to be
        esteemed a sceptic than the other.
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> I acknowledge it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> How Cometh it to pass then, Hylas, that you pronounce me
        a sceptic, because I deny what you affirm, to wit, the existence of Matter? Since, for aught you can tell, I am as <span class="tooltip">peremptory<span class="tooltiptext">(especially of a person's manner or actions) insisting on immediate attention or obedience, especially in a brusquely imperious way.</span></span> in my
        denial, as you in your affirmation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> Hold, Philonous, I have been a little out in my definition;
        but every false step a man makes in discourse is not to be insisted on. I said indeed that a sceptic was one who doubted of everything;
        but I should have added, or who denies the reality and truth of
        things.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> What things? Do you mean the principles and theorems
        of sciences? But these you know are universal intellectual notions, and consequently independent of Matter. The denial therefore of
        this doth not imply the denying them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> I grant it. But are there no other things? What think you
        of distrusting the senses, of denying the real existence of sensible
        things, or pretending to know nothing of them. Is not this sufficient
        to denominate a man a sceptic?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> Shall we therefore examine which of us it is that denies the
        reality of sensible things, or professes the greatest ignorance of them; since, if I take you rightly, he is to be esteemed the greatest
        sceptic?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> That is what I desire.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> What mean you by Sensible Things?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> Those things which are perceived by the senses. Can you
        imagine that I mean anything else?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> Pardon me, Hylas, if I am desirous clearly to apprehend
        your notions, since this may much shorten our inquiry. Suffer me
        then to ask you this farther question. Are those things only perceived by the senses which are perceived immediately? Or, may those things properly be said to be sensible which are perceived mediately,
        or not without the intervention of others?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> I do not sufficiently understand you.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> In reading a book, what I immediately perceive are the
        letters; but mediately, or by means of these, are suggested to my
        mind the notions of God, virtue, truth, &c. Now, that the letters are
        truly sensible things, or perceived by sense, there is no doubt: but I would know whether you take the things suggested by them to be
        so too.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> No, certainly: it were absurd to think God or virtue sensible things; though they may be signified and suggested to the mind
        by sensible marks, with which they have an arbitrary connexion.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> It seems then, that by sensible things you mean those only
        which can be perceived immediately by sense?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> Right.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> Doth it not follow from this, that though I see one part of
        the sky red, and another blue, and that my reason doth thence evidently conclude there must be some cause of that diversity of colours, yet that cause cannot be said to be a sensible thing, or perceived by the
        sense of seeing?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> It doth.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> In like manner, though I hear variety of sounds, yet I cannot be said to hear the causes of those sounds?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> You cannot.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> And when by my touch I perceive a thing to be hot and
        heavy, I cannot say, with any truth or propriety, that I feel the cause
        of its heat or weight?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> To prevent any more questions of this kind, I tell you once
        for all, that by sensible things I mean those only which are perceived
        by sense; and that in truth the senses perceive nothing which they
        do not perceive immediately: for they make no inferences. The deducing therefore of causes or occasions from effects and appearances, which alone are perceived by sense, entirely relates to reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> This point then is agreed between us — That sensible things
        are those only which are immediately perceived by sense. You will farther inform me, whether we immediately perceive by sight anything
        beside light, and colours, and figures; or by hearing, anything
        but sounds; by the palate, anything beside tastes; by the smell, beside
        odours; or by the touch, more than tangible qualities.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> We do not.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> It seems, therefore, that if you take away all sensible qualities,
        there remains nothing sensible?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> I grant it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> Sensible things therefore are nothing else but so many sensible qualities, or combinations of sensible qualities?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> Nothing else.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> Heat then is a sensible thing?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> Certainly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> Doth the reality of sensible things consist in being perceived?
        or, is it something distinct from their being perceived, and that bears no relation to the mind?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> To exist is one thing, and to be perceived is another.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> I speak with regard to sensible things only. And of these
        I ask, whether by their real existence you mean a subsistence exterior
        to the mind, and distinct from their being perceived?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> I mean a real absolute being, distinct from, and without
        any relation to, their being perceived.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> Heat therefore, if it be allowed a real being, must exist without the mind?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> It must.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> Tell me, Hylas, is this real existence equally compatible to
        all degrees of heat, which we perceive; or is there any reason why we
        should attribute it to some, and deny it to others? And if there be,
        pray let me know that reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> Whatever degree of heat we perceive by sense, we may be
        sure the same exists in the object that occasions it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> What! the greatest as well as the least?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> I tell you, the reason is plainly the same in respect of both. They are both perceived by sense; nay, the greater degree of heat
        is more sensibly perceived; and consequently, if there is any difference, we are more certain of its real existence than we can be of the
        reality of a lesser degree.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> But is not the most vehement and intense degree of heat a very great pain?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> No one can deny it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> And is any unperceiving thing capable of pain or pleasure?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> No, certainly.
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> Is your material substance a senseless being, or a being endowed with sense and perception?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> It is senseless without doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> It cannot therefore be the subject of pain?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> By no means.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> Nor consequently of the greatest heat perceived by sense, since you acknowledge this to be no small pain?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> I grant it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> What shall we say then of your external object; is it a material
        Substance, or no?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> It is a material substance with the sensible qualities inhering
        in it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> How then can a great heat exist in it, since you own it cannot in a material substance? I desire you would clear this point.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> Hold, Philonous, I fear I was out in yielding intense heat to be a pain. It should seem rather, that pain is something distinct from
        heat, and the consequence or effect of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> Upon putting your hand near the fire, do you perceive one
        simple uniform sensation, or two distinct sensations?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> But one simple sensation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> Is not the heat immediately perceived?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> It is.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> And the pain?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> True.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> Seeing therefore they are both immediately perceived at the same time, and the fire affects you only with one simple or uncompounded idea, it follows that this same simple idea is both the
        intense heat immediately perceived, and the pain; and, consequencely,
        that the intense heat immediately perceived is nothing distinct from
        a particular sort of pain.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> It seems so.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> Again, try in your thoughts, Hylas, if you can conceive a vehement sensation to be without pain or pleasure.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> I cannot.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> Or can you frame to yourself an idea of sensible pain or
        pleasure in general, abstracted from every particular idea of heat,
        cold, tastes, smells? &c.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> I do not find that I can.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> Doth it not therefore follow, that sensible pain is nothing
        distinct from those sensations or ideas, in an intense degree?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> It is undeniable; and, to speak the truth, I begin to suspect
        a very great heat cannot exist but in a mind perceiving it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> What! are you then in that sceptical state of suspense, between affirming and denying?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> I think I may be positive in the point. A very violent and
        painful heat cannot exist without the mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> It hath not therefore according to you, any real being?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> I own it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> Is it therefore certain, that there is no body in nature really
        hot?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> I have not denied there is any real heat in bodies. I only say, there is no such thing as an intense real heat.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> But, did you not say before that all degrees of heat were
        equally real; or, if there was any difference, that the greater were more undoubtedly real than the lesser?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> True: but it was because I did not then consider the ground
        there is for distinguishing between them, which I now plainly see. And it is this: because intense heat is nothing else but a particular
        kind of painful sensation; and pain cannot exist but in a perceiving being; it follows that no intense heat can really exist in an unperceiving corporeal substance. But this is no reason why we should deny heat in an inferior degree to exist in such a substance.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> But how shall we be able to discern those degrees of heat
        which exist only in the mind from those which exist without it?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> That is no difficult matter. You know the least pain cannot
        exist unperceived; whatever, therefore, degree of heat is a pain exists only in the mind. But, as for all other degrees of heat, nothing
        obliges us to think the same of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> I think you granted before that no unperceiving being was
        capable of pleasure, any more than of pain.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> I did.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> And is not warmth, or a more gentle degree of heat than
        what causes uneasiness, a pleasure?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> What then?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> Consequently, it cannot exist without the mind in an unperceiving
        substance, or body.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> So it seems.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> Since, therefore, as well those degrees of heat that are not
        painful, as those that are, can exist only in a thinking substance; may
        we not conclude that external bodies are absolutely incapable of any
        degree of heat whatsoever?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> On second thoughts, I do not think it so evident that warmth
        is a pleasure as that a great degree of heat is a pain.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> I do not pretend that warmth is as great a pleasure as heat
        is a pain. But, if you grant it to be even a small pleasure, it serves
        to make good my conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> I could rather call it an <span class="tooltip">indolence<span class="tooltiptext">avoidance of activity or exertion; laziness.</span></span>. It seems to be nothing more than a <span class="tooltip">privation<span class="tooltiptext">deprivation; the loss or absence of a quality or attribute that is normally present.</span></span> of both pain and pleasure. And that such a quality or state as this may agree to an unthinking substance, I hope
        you will not deny.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> If you are resolved to maintain that warmth, or a gentle
        degree of heat, is no pleasure, I know not how to convince you otherwise than by appealing to your own sense. But what think you
        of cold?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> The same that I do of heat. An intense degree of cold is a
        pain; for to feel a very great cold, is to perceive a great uneasiness:
        it cannot therefore exist without the mind; but a lesser degree of
        cold may, as well as a lesser degree of heat.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> Those bodies, therefore, upon whose application to our own, we perceive a moderate degree of heat, must be concluded to have a moderate degree of heat or warmth in them; and those, upon
        whose application we feel a like degree of cold, must be thought to have cold in them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> They must.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> Can any doctrine be true that necessarily leads a man into an absurdity?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> Without doubt it cannot.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> Is it not an absurdity to think that the same thing should be
        at the same time both cold and warm?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> It is.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> Suppose now one of your hands hot, and the other cold,
        and that they are both at once put into the same vessel of water, in an intermediate state; will not the water seem cold to one hand, and warm to the other?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> It will.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> Ought we not therefore, by your principles, to conclude
        it is really both cold and warm at the same time, that is, according
        to your own concession, to believe an absurdity?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> I confess it seems so.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> Consequently, the principles themselves are false, since you
        have granted that no true principle leads to an absurdity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> But, after all, can anything be more absurd than to say, there
        is no heat in the fire?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> To make the point still clearer; tell me whether, in two
        cases exactly alike, we ought not to make the same judgment?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> We ought.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> When a pin pricks your finger, doth it not rend and divide
        the fibres of your flesh?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> It doth.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> And when a coal burns your finger, doth it any more?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> It doth not.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> Since, therefore, you neither judge the sensation itself occasioned by the pin, nor anything like it to be in the pin; you should
        not, conformably to what you have now granted, judge the sensation occasioned by the fire, or anything like it, to be in the fire.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> Well, since it must be so, I am content to yield this point,
        and acknowledge that heat and cold are only sensations existing in our minds. But there still remain qualities enough to secure the
        reality of external things.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> But what will you say, Hylas, if it shall appear that the
        case is the same with regard to all other sensible qualities, and that they can no more be supposed to exist without the mind, than heat and cold?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> Then indeed you will have done something to the purpose;
        but that is what I despair of seeing proved.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> Let us examine them in order. What think you of tastes — do they exist without the mind, or no?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> Can any man in his senses doubt whether sugar is sweet, or wormwood bitter?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> Inform me, Hylas. Is a sweet taste a particular kind of pleasure or pleasant sensation, or is it not?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> It is.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> And is not bitterness some kind of uneasiness or pain?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> I grant it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> If therefore sugar and wormwood are unthinking corporeal substances existing without the mind, how can sweetness and bitterness,
        that is, pleasure and pain, agree to them?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> Hold, Philonous, I now see what it was deluded me all this time. You asked whether heat and cold, sweetness and bitterness, were not particular sorts of pleasure and pain; to which I answered
        simply, that they were. Whereas I should have thus distinguished: — those qualities, as perceived by us, are pleasures or pains; but not as existing in the external objects. We must not therefore conclude
        absolutely, that there is no heat in the fire, or sweetness in the
        sugar, but only that heat or sweetness, as perceived by us, are not
        in the fire or sugar. What say you to this?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> I say it is nothing to the purpose. Our discourse proceeded
        altogether concerning sensible things, which you defined to be, the
        things we immediately perceive by our senses. Whatever other
        qualities, therefore, you speak of as distinct from these, I know
        nothing of them, neither do they at all belong to the point in dispute. You may, indeed, pretend to have discovered certain qualities
        which you do not perceive, and assert those insensible qualities exist in fire and sugar. But what use can be made of this to your present purpose, I am at a loss to conceive. Tell me then once more, do you
        acknowledge that heat and cold, sweetness and bitterness (meaning
        those qualities which are perceived by the senses), do not exist without the mind?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> I see it is to no purpose to hold out, so I give up the cause
        as to those mentioned qualities. Though I profess it sounds oddly, to say that sugar is not sweet.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Phil.</em> But, for your farther satisfaction, take this along with you:
        that which at other times seems sweet, shall, to a distempered palate,
        appear bitter. And, nothing can be plainer than that divers persons
        perceive different tastes in the same food; since that which one man
        delights in, another abhors. And how could this be, if the taste was
        something really inherent in the food?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hyl.</em> I acknowledge I know not how.
