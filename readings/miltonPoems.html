            <p>Wherein the Son of Heaven's eternal King,</p>
            <p>Of wedded maid and Virgin Mother born,</p>
            <p>Our great redemption from above did bring;</p>
            <p>For so the holy sages once did sing,</p>
            <p>That he our deadly forfeit should release,</p>
            <p>And with his Father work us a perpetual peace.</p>

            <p>He laid aside, and, here with us to be,</p>
            <p>Forsook the Courts of everlasting Day,</p>

            <p>Afford a present to the Infant God?</p>

            <p>The star-led Wisards haste with odours sweet!</p>
            <p>Oh! run; prevent them with thy humble ode,</p>

            <p>Have thou the honour first thy Lord to greet,</p>
            <p>And join thy voice unto the Angel Quire,</p>
            <p>From out his secret altar touched with hallowed fire.</p>

        <h2>A PARAPHRASE ON PSALM CXIV (1624)</h2>
        <section class="poem-section">
          <p>When the blest seed of Terah's faithful Son</p>
          <p>After long toil their liberty had won,</p>
          <p>And passed from Pharian fields to Canaan Land,</p>
          <p>Led by the strength of the Almighty's hand,</p>
          <p>Jehovah's wonders were in Israel shown,</p>
          <p>His praise and glory was in Israel known.</p>
          <p>That saw the troubled sea, and shivering fled,</p>
          <p>And sought to hide his froth-becurled head</p>
          <p>Low in the earth; Jordan's clear streams recoil,</p>
          <p>As a faint host that hath received the foil.</p>
          <p>The high huge-bellied mountains skip like rams</p>
          <p>Amongst their ewes, the litde hills like lambs.</p>
          <p>Why fled the ocean? and why skipped the mountains?</p>
          <p>Why turned Jordan toward his crystal fountains?</p>
          <p>Shake, Earth, and at the presence be aghast</p>
          <p>Of Him that ever was and aye shall last,</p>
          <p>That glassy floods from rugged rocks can crush,</p>
          <p>And make soft rills from fiery flint-stones gush.</p>
