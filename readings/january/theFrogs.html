      <p>
        XANTHIAS.  SHALL I crack any of those old jokes, master, <br>
  At which the audience never fail to laugh?
      </p>

      <p>
        DIONYSUS.  Aye, what you will, except I’m getting crushed: <br>
        Fight shy of that: I’m sick of that already.
      </p>

      <p>
        XAN.  Nothing else smart?
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  Aye, save my shoulder’s aching.
      </p>

      <p>
        XAN.  Come now, that comical joke?
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  With all my heart. <br>
        Only be careful not to shift your pole. <br>
        And—  XAN. What?  DIO. And vow that you’ve a belly-ache.
      </p>

      <p>
        XAN.  May I not say I’m overburdened so <br>
        That if none ease me, I must ease myself?
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  For mercy’s sake, not till I’m going to vomit.
      </p>

      <p>
        XAN.  What! must I bear these burdens, and not make <br>
        One of the jokes Ameipsias and Lycis <br>
        And Phrynichus, in every play they write, <br>
        Put in the mouths of all their burden-bearers?
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  Don’t make them; no! I tell you when I see <br>
        Their plays, and hear those jokes, I come away <br>
        More than a twelvemonth older than I went.
      </p>

      <p>
        XAN.  O, thrice unlucky neck of mine, which now <br>
        Is getting crushed, yet must not crack its joke!
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  Now is not this fine pampered insolence <br>
        When I myself, Dionysus, son of—Pipkin, <br>
        Toil on afoot, and let this fellow ride, <br>
        Taking no trouble, and no burden bearing?
      </p>

      <p>
        XAN.  What, don’t I bear?  DIO. How can you when you’re riding?
      </p>

      <p>
        XAN.  Why, I bear these.  DIO. How?  XAN. Most unwillingly.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  Does not the donkey bear the load you’re bearing?
      </p>

      <p>
        XAN.  Not what I bear myself: by Zeus, not he.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  How can you bear, when you are borne yourself?
      </p>

      <p>
        XAN.  Don’t know: but anyhow my shoulder’s aching.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  Then since you say the donkey helps you not, <br>
        You lift him up and carry him in turn.
      </p>

      <p>
        XAN.  O, hang it all! why didn’t I fight at sea? <br>
        You should have smarted bitterly for this.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  Get down, you rascal; I’ve been trudging on <br>
        Till now I’ve reached the portal, where I’m going <br>
        First to turn in. Boy! Boy! I say there, Boy!
      </p>

      <p>
        HERACLES. Who banged the door? How like a prancing Centaur <br>
        He drove against it! Mercy o’ me, what’s this?
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  Boy.  XAN. Yes.  DIO. Did you observe?  XAN. What?  DIO. How alarmed <br>
        He is.  XAN. Aye, truly, lest you’ve lost your wits.
      </p>

      <p>
        HER.  O, by Demeter, I can’t choose but laugh. <br>
        Biting my lips won’t stop me. Ha! ha! ha!
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  Pray you, come hither, I have need of you.
      </p>

      <p>
        HER.  I vow I can’t help laughing, I can’t help it. <br>
        A lion’s hide upon a yellow silk, <br>
        A club and buskin! What’s it all about? <br>
        Where were you going?  DIO. I was serving lately <br>
        Aboard the—Cleisthenes.  HER. And fought?  DIO. And sank <br>
        More than a dozen of the enemy’s ships.
      </p>

      <p>
        HER.  You two?  DIO. We two.  HER. And then I awoke, and lo!
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  There as, on deck, I’m reading to myself <br>
        The “Andromeda,” a sudden pang of longing <br>
        Shoots through my heart, you can’t conceive how keenly.
      </p>

      <p>
        HER.  How big a pang?  DIO. A small one, Molon’s size.
      </p>

      <p>
        HER.  Caused by a woman?  DIO. No.  HER. A boy?  DIO. No, no.
      </p>

      <p>
        HER.  A man?  DIO. Ah! ah!  HER. Was it for Cleisthenes?
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  Don’t mock me, brother; on my life I am <br>
        In a bad way: such fierce desire consumes me.
      </p>

      <p>
        HER.  Aye, little brother? how?  DIO. I can’t describe it. <br>
        But yet I’ll tell you in a riddling way. <br>
        Have you e’er felt a sudden lust for soup?
      </p>

      <p>
        HER.  Soup! Zeus-a-mercy, yes, ten thousand times.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  Is the thing clear, or must I speak again?
      </p>

      <p>
        HER.  Not of the soup: I’m clear about the soup.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  Well, just that sort of pang devours my heart <br>
        For lost Euripides.  HER. A dead man too.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  And no one shall persuade me not to go <br>
        After the man.  HER. Do you mean below, to Hades?
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  And lower still, if there’s a lower still.
      </p>

      <p>
        HER.  What on earth for?  DIO. I want a genuine poet, <br>
        “For some are not, and those that are, are bad.”
      </p>

      <p>
        HER.  What! does not Iophon live?  DIO. Well, he’s the sole <br>
        Good thing remaining, if even he is good. <br>
        For even of that I’m not exactly certain.
      </p>

      <p>
        HER.  If go you must, there’s Sophocles—he comes <br>
        Before Euripides—why not take him?
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  Not till I’ve tried if Iophon’s coin rings true <br>
        When he’s alone, apart from Sophocles. <br>
        Besides, Euripides, the crafty rogue, <br>
        Will find a thousand shifts to get away, <br>
        But he was easy here, is easy there.
      </p>

      <p>
        HER.  But Agathon, where is he?  DIO. He has gone and left us. <br>
        A genial poet, by his friends much missed.
      </p>

      <p>
        HER.  Gone where?  DIO. To join the blessed in their banquets.
      </p>

      <p>
        HER.  But what of Xenocles?  DIO. O, he be hanged!
      </p>

      <p>
        HER.  Pythangelus?  XAN. But never a word of me, <br>
        Not though my shoulder’s chafed so terribly.
      </p>

      <p>
        HER.  But have you not a shoal of little songsters, <br>
        Tragedians by the myriad, who can chatter <br>
        A furlong faster than Euripides?
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  Those be mere vintage-leavings, jabberers, choirs <br>
        Of swallow-broods, degraders of their art, <br>
        Who get one chorus, and are seen no more, <br>
        The Muses’ love once gained. But, O my friend, <br>
        Search where you will, you’ll never find a true <br>
        Creative genius, uttering startling things.
      </p>

      <p>
        HER.  Creative? how do you mean?  DIO. I mean a man <br>
        Who’ll dare some novel venturesome conceit, <br>
        Air, Zeus’ chamber, or Time’s foot, or this: <br>
        ’Twas not my mind that swore: my tongue committed <br>
        A little perjury on its own account.
      </p>

      <p>
        HER.  You like that style?  DIO. Like it? I dote upon it.
      </p>

      <p>
        HER.  I vow it’s ribald nonsense, and you know it.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  “Rule not my mind”: you’ve got a house to mind.
      </p>

      <p>
        HER.  Really and truly, though, ’tis paltry stuff.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  Teach me to dine!  XAN. But never a word of me.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  But tell me truly—’twas for this I came <br>
        Dressed up to mimic you—what friends received <br>
        And entertained you when you went below <br>
        To bring back Cerberus, in case I need them.<br>
        And tell me too the havens, fountains, shops,<br>
        Roads, resting-places, stews, refreshment rooms,<br>
        Towns, lodgings, hostesses, with whom were found <br>
        The fewest bugs.  XAN. But never a word of me.
      </p>

      <p>
        HER.  You are really game to go?
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  O, drop that, can’t you? <br>
        And tell me this: of all the roads you know, <br>
        Which is the quickest way to get to Hades? <br>
        I want one not too warm, nor yet too cold.
      </p>

      <p>
        HER.  Which shall I tell you first? which shall it be? <br>
        There’s one by rope and bench: you launch away <br>
        And—hang yourself.  DIO. No, thank you: that’s too stifling.
      </p>

      <p>
        HER.  Then there’s a track, a short and beaten cut, <br>
        By pestle and mortar.  DIO. Hemlock, do you mean?
      </p>

      <p>
        HER.  Just so.  DIO. No, that’s too deathly cold a way; <br>
        You have hardly started ere your shins get numbed.
      </p>

      <p>
        HER.  Well, would you like a steep and swift descent?
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  Aye, that’s the style: my walking powers are small.
      </p>

      <p>
        HER.  Go down to the Cerameicus.  DIO. And do what?
      </p>

      <p>
        HER.  Climb to the tower’s top pinnacle—  DIO. And then?
      </p>

      <p>
        HER.  Observe the torch-race started, and when all <br>
        The multitude is shouting Let them go, <br>
        Let yourself go.  DIO. Go whither?  HER. To the ground.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  O, that would break my brain’s two envelopes. <br>
        I’ll not try that.  HER. Which will you try?  DIO. The way <br>
        You went yourself.  HER. A parlous voyage that, <br>
        For first you’ll come to an enormous lake <br>
        Of fathomless depth.  DIO. And how and I to cross?
      </p>

      <p>
        HER.  An ancient mariner will row you over <br>
        In a wee boat, so big. The fare’s two obols.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  Fie! The power two obols have, the whole world through! <br>
        How came they thither?  HER. Theseus took them down. <br>
        And next you’ll see great snakes and savage monsters <br>
        In tens of thousands.  DIO. You needn’t try to scare me, <br>
        I’m going to go.  HER. Then weltering seas of filth <br>
        And ever-rippling dung: and plunged therein, <br>
        Whoso has wronged the stranger here on earth, <br>
        Or robbed his boylove of the promised pay, <br>
        Or swinged his mother, or profanely smitten <br>
        His father’s cheek, or sworn an oath forsworn, <br>
        Or copied out a speech of Morsimus.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  There too, perdie, should he be plunged, whoe’er <br>
        Has danced the sword-dance of Cinesias.
      </p>

      <p>
        HER.  And next the breath of flutes will float around you, <br>
        And glorious sunshine, such as ours, you’ll see,<br>
        And myrtle groves, and happy bands who clap <br>
        Their hands in triumph, men and women too.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  And who are they?  HER. The happy mystic bands,
      </p>

      <p>
        XAN.  And I’m the donkey in the mystery show. <br>
        But I’ll not stand it, not one instant longer.
      </p>

      <p>
        HER.  Who’ll tell you everything you want to know. <br>
        You’ll find them dwelling close beside the road <br>
        You are going to travel, just at Pluto’s gate. <br>
        And fare thee well, my brother.  DIO. And to you <br>
        Good cheer. (To Xan.) Now, sirrah, pick you up the traps.
      </p>

      <p>
        XAN.  Before I’ve put them down?  DIO. And quickly too.
      </p>

      <p>
        XAN.  No, prithee, no; but hire a body, one <br>
        They’re carrying out, on purpose for the trip.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  If I can’t find one?  XAN. Then I’ll take them.  DIO. Good. <br>
        And see! they are carrying out a body now. <br>
        Hallo! you there, you deadman, are you willing <br>
        To carry down our little traps to Hades?
      </p>

      <p>
        CORPSE. What are they?  DIO. These.  CORP. Two drachmas for the job?
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  Nay, that’s too much.  CORP. Out of the pathway, you!
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  Beshrew thee, stop: maybe we’ll strike a bargain.
      </p>

      <p>
        CORP.  Pay me two drachmas, or it’s no use talking.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  One and a half.  CORP. I’d liefer live again!
      </p>

      <p>
        XAN.  How absolute the knave is! He be hanged! <br>
        I’ll go myself.  DIO. You’re the right sort, my man. <br>
        Now to the ferry.  CHARON. Yoh, up! lay her to.
      </p>

      <p>
        XAN.  Whatever’s that?  DIO. Why, that’s the lake, by Zeus, <br>
        Whereof he spake, and yon’s the ferry-boat.
      </p>

      <p>
        XAN.  Poseidon, yes, and that old fellow’s Charon.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  Charon! O welcome, Charon! welcome, Charon!
      </p>

      <p>
        CHAR.  Who’s for the Rest from every pain and ill? <br>
        Who’s for the Lethe’s plain? the Donkey-shearings? <br>
        Who’s for Cerberia? Taenarum? or the Ravens?
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  I.  CHAR. Hurry in.  DIO. But where are you going really? <br>
        In truth to the Ravens?  CHAR. Aye, for your behoof. <br>
        Step in.  DIO. (To Xan.) Now, lad.  CHAR. A slave? I take no slave, <br>
        Unless he has fought for his bodyrights at sea.
      </p>

      <p>
        XAN.  I couldn’t go. I’d got the eye-disease.
      </p>

      <p>
        CHAR.  Then fetch a circuit round about the lake.
      </p>

      <p>
        XAN.  Where must I wait?  CHAR. Beside the Withering stone, <br>
        Hard by the Rest.  DIO. You understand?  XAN. Too well. <br>
        O, what ill omen crossed me as I started!
      </p>

      <p>
        CHAR.  (To Dio.) Sit to the oar. (Calling.) Who else for the boat? Be quick. <br>
        (To Dio.) Hi! What are you doing?  DIO. What am I doing? Sitting <br>
        On to the oar. You told me to, yourself.
      </p>

      <p>
        CHAR.  Now sit you there, you little Potgut.  DIO. So?
      </p>

      <p>
        CHAR.  Now stretch your arms full length before you.  DIO. So?
      </p>

      <p>
        CHAR.  Come, don’t keep fooling; plant your feet, and now <br>
        Pull with a will.  DIO. Why, how am I to pull? <br>
        I’m not an oarsman, seaman, Salaminian. <br>
        I can’t!  CHAR. You can. Just dip your oar in once, <br>
        You’ll hear the loveliest timing songs.  DIO. What from?
      </p>

      <p>
        CHAR.  Frog-swans, most wonderful.  DIO. Then give the word.
      </p>

      <p>
        CHAR.  Heave ahoy! heave ahoy!
      </p>

      <p>
        FROGS.  Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax! <br>
        Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax! <br>
        We children of the fountain and the lake, <br>
              Let us wake <br>
        Our full choir-shout, as the flutes are ringing out, <br>
        Our symphony of clear-voiced song. <br>
        The song we used to love, in the Marshland up above, <br>
          In praise of Dionysus to produce, <br>
          Of Nysaean Dionysus, son of Zeus, <br>
        When the revel-tipsy throng, all crapulous and gay, <br>
        To our precinct reeled along on the holy <br>
                  Pitcher day. <br>
        Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  O, dear! O, dear! now I declare <br>
        I’ve got a bump upon my rump.
      </p>

      <p>
        FR.  Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  But you, perchance, don’t care.
      </p>

      <p>
        FR.  Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  Hang you, and your ko-axing too! <br>
        There’s nothing but ko-ax with you.

      <p>
        FR.  That is right, Mr. Busybody, right! <br>
        For the Muses of the lyre love us well; <br>
        And hornfoot Pan who plays on the pipe his jocund lays; <br>
        And Apollo, Harper bright, in our Chorus takes delight; <br>
        For the strong reed’s sake which I grow within my lake <br>
              To be girdled in his lyre’s deep shell. <br>
                Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  My hands are blistered very sore; <br>
        My stern below is sweltering so, <br>
        ’Twill soon, I know, upturn and roar <br>
        Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax. <br>
        O tuneful race, O, pray give o’er, <br>
        O, sing no more.  FR. Ah, no! ah, no! <br>
        Loud and louder our chant must flow. <br>
        Sing if ever ye sang of yore, <br>
        When in sunny and glorious days <br>
        Through the rushes and marsh-flags springing <br>
        On we swept, in the joy of singing <br>
        Myriad-diving roundelays. <br>
        Or when fleeing the storm, we went <br>
        Down to the depths, and our choral song <br>
        Wildly raised to a loud and long <br>
        Bubble-bursting accompaniment.
      </p>

      <p>
        FR.  and DIO. Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  This timing song I take from you.
      </p>

      <p>
        FR.  That’s a dreadful thing to do.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  Much more dreadful, if I row <br>
        Till I burst myself, I trow.
      </p>

      <p>
        FR.  and DIO. Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  Go, hang yourselves; for what care I?
      </p>

      <p>
        FR.  All the same we’ll shout and cry, <br>
        Stretching all our throats with song, <br>
        Shouting, crying, all day long,
      </p>

      <p>
        FR.  and DIO. Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  In this you’ll never, never win.
      </p>

      <p>
        FR.  This you shall not beat us in.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  No, nor ye prevail o’er me. <br>
        Never! never! I’ll my song <br>
        Shout, if need be, all day long, <br>
        Until I’ve learned to master your ko-ax. <br>
        Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax. <br>
        I thought I’d put a stop to your ko-ax.
      </p>

      <p>
        CHAR.  Stop! Easy! Take the oar and push her to. <br>
        Now pay your fare and go.  DIO. Here ’tis: two obols. <br>
        Xanthias! where’s Xanthias? Is it Xanthias there?
      </p>

      <p>
        XAN.  Hoi, hoi!  DIO. Come hither.  XAN. Glad to meet you, master.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  What have you there?  XAN. Nothing but filth and darkness.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  But tell me, did you see the parricides <br>
        And perjured folk he mentioned?  XAN. Didn’t you?
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  Poseidon, yes. Why, look! (Pointing to the audience.) I see them now. <br>
        What’s the next step?  XAN. We’d best be moving on. <br>
        This is the spot where Heracles declared <br>
        Those savage monsters dwell.  DIO. O, hang the fellow! <br>
        That’s all his bluff: he thought to scare me off, <br>
        The jealous dog, knowing my plucky ways. <br>
        There’s no such swaggerer lives as Heracles. <br>
        Why, I’d like nothing better than to achieve <br>
        Some bold adventure, worthy of our trip.
      </p>

      <p>
        XAN.  I know you would. Hallo! I hear a noise.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  Where? what?  XAN. Behind us, there.  DIO. Get you behind.
      </p>

      <p>
        XAN.  No, it’s in front.  DIO. Get you in front directly.
      </p>

      <p>
        XAN.  And now I see the most ferocious monster.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  O, what’s it like?  XAN. Like everything by turns. <br>
        Now it’s a bull: now it’s a mule: and now <br>
        The loveliest girl.  DIO. O, where? I’ll go and meet her.
      </p>

      <p>
        XAN.  It’s ceased to be a girl: it’s a dog now.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  It is Empusa!  XAN. Well, its face is all <br>
        Ablaze with fire.  DIO. Has it a copper leg?
      </p>

      <p>
        XAN.  A copper leg? yes, one; and one of cow dung.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  O, whither shall I flee?  XAN. O, whither I?
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  My priest, protect me, and we’ll sup together.
      </p>

      <p>
        XAN.  King Heracles, we’re done for.  DIO. O, forbear,
        Good fellow, call me anything but that.
      </p>

      <p>
        XAN.  Well, then, Dionysus.  DIO. O, that’s worse again.
      </p>

      <p>
        XAN.  (To the Spectre.) Aye, go thy way. O master, here, come here.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  O, what’s up now?  XAN. Take courage; all’s serene. <br>
        And, like Hegelochus, we now may say, <br>
        “Out of the storm there comes a new fine wether.” <br>
        Empusa’s gone.  DIO. Swear it.  XAN. By Zeus she is.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  Swear it again.  XAN. By Zeus.  DIO. Again.  XAN. By Zeus. <br>
        O, dear, O, dear, how pale I grew to see her, <br>
        But he from fright has yellowed me all over.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  Ah me, whence fall these evils on my head? <br>
        Who is the god to blame for my destruction? <br>
        Air, Zeus’ chamber, or the Foot of Time?
      </p>

      <p>
        (A flute is played behind the scenes.)
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  Hist!  XAN. What’s the matter?  DIO. Didn’t you hear it?
      </p>

      <p>
        XAN.  What?
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  The breath of flutes.  XAN. Aye, and a whiff of torches <br>
        Breathed o’er me too; a very mystic whiff.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  Then crouch we down, and mark what’s going on.
      </p>

      <p>
        CHORUS.  (In the distance.)  O Iacchus! <br>
            O Iacchus! O Iacchus!
      </p>

      <p>
        XAN.  O have it, master: ’tis those blessed Mystics, <br>
        Of whom he told us, sporting hereabouts. <br>
        They sing the Iacchus which Diagoras made.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  I think so too: we had better both keep quiet <br>
        And so find out exactly what it is.
      </p>

      <p>
        (The calling forth of Iacchus.)
      </p>

      <p>
        CHOR.  O Iacchus! power excelling, here in stately temples dwelling, <br>
              O Iacchus! O Iacchus! <br>
              Come to tread this verdant level, <br>
              Come to dance in mystic revel, <br>
              Come whilst round thy forehead hurtles <br>
              Many a wreath of fruitful myrtles, <br>
              Come with wild and saucy paces <br>
              Mingling in our joyous dance, <br>
        Pure and holy, which embraces all the charms of all the Graces, <br>
              When the mystic choirs advance.
      </p>

      <p>
        XAN.  Holy and sacred queen, Demeter’s daughter, <br>
        O, what a jolly whiff of pork breathed o’er me!
      </p>

      <p>
        DIO.  Hist! and perchance you’ll get some tripe yourself.
      </p>

      <p>
        (The welcome to Iacchus.)
      </p>

      <p>
        CHOR.  Come, arise, from sleep awaking, come the fiery torches shaking, <br>
              O Iacchus! O Iacchus! <br>
              Morning Star that shinest nightly. <br>
              Lo, the mead is blazing brightly, <br>
              Age forgets its years and sadness, <br>
              Agèd knees curvet for gladness, <br>
              Lift thy flashing torches o’er us, <br>
              Marshal all thy blameless train, <br>
        Lead, O, lead the way before us; lead the lovely youthful Chorus <br>
              To the marshy flowery plain.
