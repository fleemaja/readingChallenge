      <h2>I</h2>

      <p>
        WAKE!  For the Sun behind yon Eastern height <br>
        Has chased the Session of the Stars from Night;<br>
            And to the field of Heav’n ascending, strikes<br>
        The Sulta´n’s Turret with a Shaft of Light.
      </p>

      <h2>II</h2>

      <p>
        Before the phantom of False morning died,<br>
        Methought a Voice within the Tavern cried,<br>
            “When all the Temple is prepared within,<br>
        Why lags the drowsy Worshipper outside?”
      </p>

      <h2>III</h2>

      <p>
        And, as the Cock crew, those who stood before<br>
        The Tavern shouted—“Open then the Door!<br>
            You know how little while we have to stay,<br>
        And, once departed, may return no more.”
      </p>

      <h2>IV</h2>

      <p>
        Now the New Year reviving old Desires,<br>
        The thoughtful Soul to Solitude retires,<br>
            Where the WHITE  HAND OF  MOSES  on the Bough<br>
        Puts out, and Jesus from the Ground suspires.
      </p>

      <h2>V</h2>

      <p>
        Iram indeed is gone with all his Rose,<br>
        And Jamshy´d’s Sev’n-ring’d Cup where no one knows;<br>
            But still a Ruby gushes from the Vine,<br>
        And many a Garden by the Water blows.
      </p>

      <h2>VI</h2>

      <p>
        And David’s lips are lockt; but in divine<br>
        High-piping Pe´hlevi, with “Wine! Wine! Wine!<br>
            Red Wine!”—the Nightingale cries to the Rose<br>
        That sallow cheek of hers to incarnadine.
      </p>

      <h2>VII</h2>

      <p>
        Come, fill the Cup, and in the fire of Spring<br>
        Your Winter-garment of Repentance fling:<br>
            The Bird of Time has but a little way<br>
        To flutter—and the Bird is on the Wing.
      </p>

      <h2>VIII</h2>

      <p>
        Whether at Naisha´pu´r or Babylon,<br>
        Whether the Cup with sweet or bitter run,<br>
            The Wine of Life keeps oozing drop by drop,<br>
        The Leaves of Life keep falling one by one.
      </p>

      <h2>IX</h2>

      <p>
        Morning a thousand Roses brings, you say;<br>
        Yes, but where leaves the Rose of Yesterday?<br>
            And this first Summer month that brings the Rose<br>
        Shall take Jamshy´d and Kaikoba´d away.
      </p>

      <h2>X</h2>

      <p>
        Well, let it take them! What have we to do<br>
        With Kaikoba´d the Great, or Kaikhosru´?<br>
            Let Rustum cry “To Battle!” as he likes,<br>
        Or Ha´tim Tai “To supper!”—heed not you.
      </p>

      <h2>XI</h2>

      <p>
        With me along the strip of Herbage strown<br>
        That just divides the desert from the sown,<br>
            Where name of Slave and Sulta´n is forgot—<br>
        And Peace to Ma´hmu´d on his golden Throne!
      </p>

      <h2>XII</h2>

      <p>
        Here with a little Bread beneath the Bough,<br>
        A Flask of Wine, a Book of Verse—and Thou<br>
            Beside me singing in the Wilderness—<br>
        Oh, Wilderness were Paradise enow!
      </p>

      <h2>XIII</h2>

      <p>
        Some for the Glories of This World; and some<br>
        Sigh for the Prophet’s Paradise to come;<br>
            Ah, take the Cash, and let the Promise go,<br>
        Nor heed the music of a distant Drum!
      </p>

      <h2>XIV</h2>

      <p>
        Were it not Folly, Spider-like to spin<br>
        The Thread of present Life away to win—<br>
            What? for ourselves, who know not if we shall<br>
        Breathe out the very Breath we now breathe in!
      </p>

      <h2>XV</h2>

      <p>
        Look to the blowing Rose about us—“Lo,<br>
        Laughing,” she says, “into the world I blow,<br>
            At once the silken tassel of my Purse<br>
        Tear, and its Treasure on the Garden throw.”
      </p>

      <h2>XVI</h2>

      <p>
        For those who husbanded the Golden grain,<br>
        And those who flung it to the winds like Rain,<br>
            Alike to no such aureate Earth are turn’d<br>
        As, buried once, Men want dug up again.
      </p>

      <h2>XVII</h2>

      <p>
        The Worldly Hope men set their Hearts upon<br>
        Turns Ashes—or it prospers; and anon,<br>
            Like Snow upon the Desert’s dusty Face,<br>
        Lighting a little hour or two—was gone.
      </p>

      <h2>XVIII</h2>

      <p>
        Think, in this batter’d Caravanserai<br>
        Whose Portals are alternate Night and Day,<br>
            How Sulta´n after Sulta´n with his Pomp<br>
        Abode his destined Hour, and went his way.
      </p>

      <h2>XIX</h2>

      <p>
        They say the Lion and the Lizard keep<br>
        The Courts where Jamshy´d gloried and drank deep:<br>
            And Bahra´m, that great Hunter—the Wild Ass<br>
        Stamps o’er his Head, but cannot break his Sleep.
      </p>

      <h2>XX</h2>

      <p>
        The Palace that to Heav’n his pillars threw,<br>
        And Kings the forehead on his threshold drew—<br>
            I saw the solitary Ringdove there,<br>
        And “Coo, coo, coo,” she cried; and “Coo, coo, coo.”
      </p>

      <h2>XXI</h2>

      <p>
        Ah, my Belove´d, fill the Cup that clears<br>
        TO-DAY  of past Regret and Future Fears:<br>
            To-morrow!—Why, To-morrow I may be<br>
        Myself with Yesterday’s Sev’n thousand Years.
      </p>

      <h2>XXII</h2>

      <p>
        For some we loved, the loveliest and the best<br>
        That from his Vintage rolling Time has prest,<br>
            Have drunk their Cup a Round or two before,<br>
        And one by one crept silently to rest.
      </p>

      <h2>XXIII</h2>

      <p>
        And we, that now make merry in the Room<br>
        They left, and Summer dresses in new bloom,<br>
            Ourselves must we beneath the Couch of Earth<br>
        Descend—ourselves to make a Couch—for whom?
      </p>

      <h2>XXIV</h2>

      <p>
        I sometimes think that never blows so red<br>
        The Rose as where some buried Cæsar bled;<br>
            That every Hyacinth the Garden wears<br>
        Dropt in her Lap from some once lovely Head.
      </p>

      <h2>XXV</h2>

      <p>
        And this delightful Herb whose living Green<br>
        Fledges the River’s Lip on which we lean—<br>
            Ah, lean upon it lightly! for who knows<br>
        From what once lovely Lip it springs unseen!
      </p>

      <h2>XXVI</h2>

      <p>
        Ah, make the most of what we yet may spend,<br>
        Before we too into the Dust descend;<br>
            Dust into Dust, and under Dust to lie<br>
        Sans Wine, sans Song, sans Singer, and—sans End!
      </p>

      <h2>XXVII</h2>

      <p>
        Alike for those who for TO-DAY  prepare,<br>
        And those that after some TO-MORROW  stare,<br>
            A Muezzi´n from the Tower of Darkness cries,<br>
        “Fools! your Reward is neither Here nor There!”
      </p>

      <h2>XXVIII</h2>

      <p>
        Another Voice, when I am sleeping, cries,<br>
        “The Flower should open with the Morning skies.”<br>
            And a retreating Whisper, as I wake—<br>
        “The Flower that once has blown for ever dies.”
      </p>

      <h2>XXIX</h2>

      <p>
        Why, all the Saints and Sages who discuss’d<br>
        Of the Two Worlds so learnedly are thrust<br>
            Like foolish Prophets forth; their Words to Scorn<br>
        Are scatter’d, and their Mouths are stopt with Dust.
      </p>

      <h2>XXX</h2>

      <p>
        Myself when young did eagerly frequent<br>
        Doctor and Saint, and heard great argument<br>
            About it and about: but evermore<br>
        Came out by the same door as in I went.
      </p>

      <h2>XXXI</h2>

      <p>
        With them the seed of Wisdom did I sow,<br>
        And with my own hand wrought to make it grow;<br>
            And this was all the Harvest that I reap’d—<br>
        “I came like Water, and like Wind I go.”
      </p>

      <h2>XXXII</h2>

      <p>
        Into this Universe, and  Why  not knowing<br>
        Nor  Whence,  like Water willy-nilly flowing;<br>
            And out of it, as Wind along the Waste,<br>
        I know not  Whither,  willy-nilly blowing.
      </p>

      <h2>XXXIII</h2>

      <p>
        What, without asking, hither hurried  Whence?<br>
        And, without asking,  Whither  hurried hence!<br>
            Ah, contrite Heav’n endowed us with the Vine<br>
        To drug the memory of that insolence!
      </p>

      <h2>XXXIV</h2>

      <p>
        Up from Earth’s Centre through the Seventh Gate<br>
        I rose, and on the Throne of Saturn sate;<br>
            And many Knots unravel’d by the Road;<br>
        But not the Master-knot of Human Fate.
      </p>

      <h2>XXXV</h2>

      <p>
        There was the Door to which I found no Key:<br>
        There was the Veil through which I could not see:<br>
            Some little talk awhile of ME  and THEE<br>
        There was—and then no more of THEE  and ME.
      </p>

      <h2>XXXVI</h2>

      <p>
        Earth could not answer; nor the Seas that mourn<br>
        In flowing Purple, of their Lord forlorn;<br>
            Nor Heaven, with those eternal Signs reveal’d<br>
        And hidden by the sleeve of Night and Morn.
      </p>

      <h2>XXXVII</h2>

      <p>
        Then of the THEE  IN ME  who works behind<br>
        The Veil of Universe I cried to find<br>
            A Lamp to guide me through the Darkness; and<br>
        Something then said—“An Understanding blind.”
      </p>

      <h2>XXXVIII</h2>

      <p>
        Then to the Lip of this poor earthen Urn<br>
        I lean’d, the secret Well of Life to learn:<br>
            And Lip to Lip it murmur’d—“While you live,<br>
        Drink!—for, once dead, you never shall return.”
      </p>

      <h2>XXXIX</h2>

      <p>
        I think the Vessel, that with fugitive<br>
        Articulation answer’d, once did live,<br>
            And drink; and that impassive Lip I kiss’d,<br>
        How many Kisses might it take—and give!
      </p>

      <h2>XL</h2>

      <p>
        For I remember stopping by the way<br>
        To watch a Potter thumping his wet Clay:<br>
            And with its all-obliterated Tongue<br>
        It murmur’d—“Gently, Brother, gently, pray!”
      </p>

      <h2>XLI</h2>

      <p>
        For has not such a Story from of Old<br>
        Down Man’s successive generations roll’d<br>
            Of such a clod of saturated Earth<br>
        Cast by the Maker into Human mould?
      </p>

      <h2>XLII</h2>

      <p>
        And not a drop that from our Cups we throw<br>
        On the parcht herbage, but may steal below<br>
            To quench the fire of Anguish in some Eye<br>
        There hidden—far beneath, and long ago.
      </p>

      <h2>XLIII</h2>

      <p>
        As then the Tulip for her wonted sup<br>
        Of Heavenly Vintage lifts her chalice up,<br>
            Do you, twin offspring of the soil, till Heav’n<br>
        To Earth invert you like an empty Cup.
      </p>

      <h2>XLIV</h2>

      <p>
        Do you, within your little hour of Grace,<br>
        The waving Cypress in your Arms enlace,<br>
            Before the Mother back into her arms<br>
        Fold, and dissolve you in a last embrace.
      </p>

      <h2>XLV</h2>

      <p>
        And if the Cup you drink, the Lip you press,<br>
        End in what All begins and ends in—Yes;<br>
            Imagine then you  are  what heretofore<br>
        You  were—hereafter you shall not be less.
      </p>

      <h2>XLVI</h2>

      <p>
        So when at last the Angel of the Drink<br>
        Of Darkness finds you by the river-brink,<br>
            And, proffering his Cup, invites your Soul<br>
        Forth to your Lips to quaff it—do not shrink.
      </p>

      <h2>XLVII</h2>

      <p>
        And fear not lest Existence closing  your<br>
        Account, should lose, or know the type no more;<br>
            The Eternal Sa´kì from that Bowl has pour’d<br>
        Millions of Bubbles like us, and will pour.
      </p>

      <h2>XLVIII</h2>

      <p>
        When You and I behind the Veil are past,<br>
        Oh, but the long long while the World shall last,<br>
            Which of our Coming and Departure heeds<br>
        As much as Ocean of a pebble-cast.
      </p>

      <h2>XLIX</h2>

      <p>
        One Moment in Annihilation’s Waste,<br>
        One Moment, of the Well of Life to taste—<br>
            The Stars are setting, and the Caravan<br>
        Draws to the Dawn of Nothing—Oh make haste.
      </p>

      <h2>L</h2>

      <p>
        Would you that spangle of Existence spend<br>
        About  THE SECRET—quick about it, Friend!<br>
            A Hair, they say, divides the False and True—<br>
        And upon what, prithee, does Life depend?
      </p>

      <h2>LI</h2>

      <p>
        A Hair, they say, divides the False and True;<br>
        Yes; and a single Alif were the clue—<br>
            Could you but find it—to the Treasure-house,<br>
        And peradventure to THE  MASTER  too;
      </p>

      <h2>LII</h2>

      <p>
        Whose secret Presence, through Creation’s veins<br>
        Running, Quicksilver-like eludes your pains;<br>
            Taking all shapes from Ma´h to Ma´hi; and<br>
        They change and perish all-but He remains;
      </p>

      <h2>LIII</h2>

      <p>
        A moment guess’d—then back behind the Fold<br>
        Immerst of Darkness round the Drama roll’d<br>
            Which, for the Pastime of Eternity,<br>
        He does Himself contrive, enact, behold.
      </p>

      <h2>LIV</h2>

      <p>
        But it in vain, down on the stubborn floor<br>
        Of Earth, and up to Heav’n’s unopening Door,<br>
            You gaze TO-DAY,  while You are YOU—how then<br>
        TO-MORROW,  You when shall be You no more?
      </p>

      <h2>LV</h2>

      <p>
        Oh, plagued no more with Human or Divine,<br>
        To-morrow’s tangle to itself resign,<br>
            And lose your fingers in the tresses of<br>
        The Cypress-slender Minister of Wine.
      </p>

      <h2>LVI</h2>

      <p>
        Waste not your Hour, nor in the vain pursuit<br>
        Of This and That endeavour and dispute;<br>
            Better be merry with the fruitful Grape<br>
        Than sadden after none, or bitter, Fruit.
      </p>

      <h2>LVII</h2>

      <p>
        You know, my Friends, how bravely in my House<br>
        For a new Marriage I did make Carouse;<br>
            Divorced old barren Reason from my Bed,<br>
        And took the Daughter of the Vine to Spouse.
      </p>

      <h2>LVIII</h2>

      <p>
        For “IS”  and “IS-NOT”  though with Rule and Line<br>
        And “UP-AND-DOWN”  by Logic I define,<br>
            Of all that one should care to fathom, I<br>
        Was never deep in anything but—Wine.
      </p>

      <h2>LIX</h2>

      <p>
        Ah, but my Computations, People say,<br>
        Have squared the Year to human compass, eh?<br>
            If so, by striking from the Calendar<br>
        Unborn To-morrow, and dead Yesterday.
      </p>

      <h2>LX</h2>

      <p>
        And lately, by the Tavern Door agape,<br>
        Came shining through the Dusk an Angel Shape<br>
            Bearing a Vessel on his Shoulder; and<br>
        He bid me taste of it; and ’twas—the Grape!
      </p>

      <h2>LXI</h2>

      <p>
        The Grape that can with Logic absolute<br>
        The Two-and-Seventy jarring Sects confute:<br>
            The sovereign Alchemist that in a trice<br>
        Life’s leaden metal into Gold transmute:
      </p>

      <h2>LXII</h2>

      <p>
        The mighty Mahmu´d, Allah-breathing Lord,<br>
        That all the misbelieving and black Horde<br>
            Of Fears and Sorrows that infest the Soul<br>
        Scatters before him with his whirlwind Sword.
      </p>

      <h2>LXIII</h2>

      <p>
        Why, be this Juice the growth of God, who dare<br>
        Blaspheme the twisted tendril as a Snare?<br>
            A Blessing, we should use it, should we not?<br>
        And if a Curse—why, then, Who set it there?
      </p>

      <h2>LXIV</h2>

      <p>
        I must abjure the Balm of Life, I must,<br>
        Scared by some After-reckoning ta’en on trust,<br>
            Or lured with Hope of some Diviner Drink,<br>
        When the frail Cup is crumbled into Dust!
      </p>

      <h2>LXV</h2>

      <p>
        If but the Vine and Love-abjuring Band<br>
        Are in the Prophet’s Paradise to stand,<br>
            Alack, I doubt the Prophet’s Paradise<br>
        Were empty as the hollow of one’s Hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        Oh threats of Hell and Hopes of Paradise!<br>
        One thing at least is certain—This  Life flies;<br>
            One thing is certain and the rest is Lies;<br>
        The Flower that once is blown for ever dies.
      </p>

      <h2>LXVII</h2>

      <p>
        Strange, is it not? that of the myriads who<br>
        Before us pass’d the door of Darkness through,<br>
            Not one returns to tell us of the Road,<br>
        Which to discover we must travel too.
      </p>

      <h2>LXVIII</h2>

      <p>
        The Revelations of Devout and Learn’d<br>
        Who rose before us, and as Prophets burn’d,<br>
            Are all but Stories, which, awoke from Sleep<br>
        They told their fellows, and to Sleep return’d.
      </p>

      <h2>LXIX</h2>

      <p>
        Why, if the Soul can fling the Dust aside,<br>
        And naked on the Air of Heaven ride,<br>
            Is’t not a Shame—is’t not a Shame for him<br>
        So long in this Clay Suburb to abide?
      </p>

      <h2>LXX</h2>

      <p>
        But that is but a Tent wherein may rest<br>
        A Sultan to the realm of Death addrest;<br>
            The Sulta´n rises, and the dark Ferra´sh<br>
        Strikes, and prepares it for another Guest.
      </p>

      <h2>LXXI</h2>

      <p>
        I sent my Soul through the Invisible,<br>
        Some letter of that After-life to spell:<br>
            And after many days my Soul return’d,<br>
        And said, “Behold, Myself am Heav’n and Hell:”
      </p>

      <h2>LXXII</h2>

      <p>
        Heav’n but the Vision of fulfill’d Desire,<br>
        And Hell the Shadow of a Soul on fire,<br>
            Cast on the Darkness into which Ourselves,<br>
        So late emerged from, shall so soon expire.
      </p>

      <h2>LXXIII</h2>

      <p>
        We are no other than a moving row<br>
        Of visionary Shapes that come and go<br>
            Round with this Sun-illumin’d Lantern held<br>
        In Midnight by the Master of the Show;
      </p>

      <h2>LXXIV</h2>

      <p>
        Impotent Pieces of the Game He plays<br>
        Upon this Chequer-board of Nights and Days;<br>
            Hither and thither moves, and checks, and slays,<br>
        And one by one back in the Closet lays.

      <p>
        The Ball no question makes of Ayes and Noes,<br>
        But Right or Left as strikes the Player goes;<br>
            And He that toss’d you down into the Field,<br>
        He  knows about it all—HE  knows—HE  knows!

      <h2>LXXVI</h2>

      <p>
        The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,<br>
        Moves on: nor all your Piety nor Wit<br>
            Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,<br>
        Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it.
      </p>

      <h2>LXXVII</h2>

      <p>
        For let Philosopher and Doctor preach<br>
        Of what they will, and what they will not—each<br>
            Is but one Link in an eternal Chain<br>
        That none can slip, nor break, nor over-reach.

      <h2>LXXVIII</h2>

      <p>
        And that inverted Bowl we call The Sky,<br>
        Whereunder crawling coop’d we live and die,<br>
            Lift not your hands to  It  for help—for It<br>
        As impotently rolls as you or I.
      </p>

      <h2>LXXIX</h2>

      <p>
        With Earth’s first Clay They did the Last Man knead,<br>
        And there of the Last Harvest sow’d the Seed:<br>
            And the first Morning of Creation wrote<br>
        What the Last Dawn of Reckoning shall read.
      </p>

      <h2>LXXX</h2>

      <p>
        YESTERDAY  This  Day’s Madness did prepare;<br>
        TO-MORROW’S  Silence, Triumph, or Despair:<br>
            Drink! for you know not whence you came, nor why:<br>
        Drink! for you know not why you go, nor where.
      </p>

      <h2>LXXXI</h2>

      <p>
        I tell you this—When, started from the Goal,<br>
        Over the flaming shoulders of the Foal<br>
            Of Heav’n Parwi´n and Mushtari they flung,<br>
        In my predestined Plot of Dust and Soul.
      </p>

      <h2>LXXXII</h2>

      <p>
        The Vine had struck a fibre: which about<br>
        If clings my being—let the Dervish flout;<br>
            Of my Base metal may be filed a Key,<br>
        That shall unlock the Door he howls without.
      </p>

      <h2>LXXXIII</h2>

      <p>
        And this I know: whether the one True Light<br>
        Kindle to Love, or Wrath-consume me quite,<br>
            One Flash of It within the Tavern caught<br>
        Better than in the Temple lost outright.
      </p>

      <h2>LXXXIV</h2>

      <p>
        What! out of senseless Nothing to provoke<br>
        A conscious Something to resent the yoke<br>
            Of unpermitted Pleasure, under pain<br>
        Of Everlasting Penalties, if broke!
      </p>

      <h2>LXXXV</h2>

      <p>
        What! from his helpless Creature be repaid<br>
        Pure Gold for what he lent us dross-allay’d<br>
            Sue for a Debt we never did contract,<br>
        And cannot answer—Oh the sorry trade!
      </p>

      <h2>LXXXVI</h2>

      <p>
        Nay, but, for terror of his wrathful Face,<br>
        I swear I will not call Injustice Grace;<br>
            Not one Good Fellow of the Tavern but<br>
        Would kick so poor a Coward from the place.
      </p>

      <h2>LXXXVII</h2>

      <p>
        Oh Thou, who didst with pitfall and with gin<br>
        Beset the Road I was to wander in,<br>
            Thou wilt not with Predestined Evil round<br>
        Enmesh, and then impute my Fall to Sin!
      </p>

      <h2>LXXXVIII</h2>

      <p>
        Oh, Thou, who Man of baser Earth didst make,<br>
        And ev’n with Paradise devise the Snake:<br>
            For all the Sin the Face of wretched Man<br>
        Is black with—Man’s Forgiveness give—and take!
      </p>

      <h2>LXXXIX</h2>

      <p>
        As under cover of departing Day<br>
        Slunk hunger-stricken Ramaza´n away,<br>
            Once more within the Potter’s house alone<br>
        I stood, surrounded by the Shapes of Clay.
      </p>

      <h2>XC</h2>

      <p>
        And once again there gather’d a scarce heard<br>
        Whisper among them; as it were, the stirr’d<br>
            Ashes of some all but extinguisht Tongue,<br>
        Which mine ear kindled into living Word.
      </p>

      <h2>XCI</h2>

      <p>
        Said one among them—“Surely not in vain<br>
        My substance from the common Earth was ta’en<br>
            That he who subtly wrought me into Shape<br>
        Should stamp me back to shapeless Earth again?”
      </p>

      <h2>XCII</h2>

      <p>
        Another said—“Why, ne’er a peevish Boy<br>
        Would break the Cup from which he drank in Joy;<br>
            Shall He that of His own free Fancy made<br>
        The Vessel, in an after-rage destroy!”
      </p>

      <h2>XCIII</h2>

      <p>
        None answer’d this; but after silence spake<br>
        Some Vessel of a more ungainly Make;<br>
            “They sneer at me for leaning all awry:<br>
        What! did the Hand then of the Potter shake?”
      </p>

      <h2>XCIV</h2>

      <p>
        Thus with the Dead as with the Living,  What?<br>
        And  Why?  so ready, but the  Wherefor  not,<br>
            One on a sudden peevishly exclaim’d,<br>
        “Which is the Potter, pray, and which the Pot?”
      </p>

      <h2>XCV</h2>

      <p>
        Said one—“Folks of a surly Master tell,<br>
        And daub his Visage with the Smoke of Hell;<br>
            They talk of some sharp Trial of us—Pish!<br>
        He’s a Good Fellow, and ’twill all be well.”
      </p>

      <h2>XCVI</h2>

      <p>
        “Well,” said another, “Whoso will, let try,<br>
        My Clay with long Oblivion is gone dry:<br>
            But fill me with the old familiar Juice,<br>
        Methinks I might recover by and by.”
      </p>

      <h2>XCVII</h2>

      <p>
        So while the Vessels one by one were speaking,<br>
        One spied the little Crescent all were seeking:<br>
            And then they jogg’d each other, “Brother! Brother!<br>
        Now for the Porter’s shoulder-knot a-creaking!”
      </p>

      <h2>XCVIII</h2>

      <p>
        Ah, with the Grape my fading Life provide,<br>
        And wash my Body whence the Life has died,<br>
            And lay me, shrouded in the living Leaf,<br>
        By some not unfrequented Garden-side.
      </p>

      <h2>XCIX</h2>

      <p>
        Whither resorting from the vernal Heat<br>
        Shall Old Acquaintance Old Acquaintance greet,<br>
            Under the Branch that leans above the Wall<br>
        To shed his Blossom over head and feet.
      </p>

      <h2>C</h2>

      <p>
        Then ev’n my buried Ashes such a snare<br>
        Of Vintage shall fling up into the Air<br>
            As not a True-believer passing by<br>
        But shall be overtaken unaware.
      </p>

      <h2>CI</h2>

      <p>
        Indeed the Idols I have loved so long<br>
        Have done my credit in Men’s eyes much wrong:<br>
            Have drown’d my Glory in a shallow Cup<br>
        And sold my Reputation for a Song.
      </p>

      <h2>CII</h2>

      <p>
        Indeed, indeed, Repentance oft before<br>
        I swore—but was I sober when I swore?<br>
            And then and then came Spring, and Rose-in-hand<br>
        My thread-bare Penitence apieces tore.
      </p>

      <h2>CIII</h2>

      <p>
        And much as Wine has play’d the Infidel,<br>
        And robb’d me of my Robe of Honour—Well,<br>
            I often wonder what the Vintners buy<br>
        One half so precious as the ware they sell.
      </p>

      <h2>CIV</h2>

      <p>
        Yet Ah, that Spring should vanish with the Rose!<br>
        That Youth’s sweet-scented manuscript should close!<br>
            The Nightingale that in the branches sang,<br>
        Ah whence, and whither flown again, who knows!
      </p>

      <h2>CV</h2>

      <p>
        Would but the Desert of the Fountain yield<br>
        One glimpse—if dimly, yet indeed, reveal’d,<br>
            Toward which the fainting Traveller might spring,<br>
        As springs the trampled herbage of the field!
      </p>

      <h2>CVI</h2>

      <p>
        Oh if the World were but to re-create,<br>
        That we might catch ere closed the Book of Fate,<br>
            And make The Writer on a fairer leaf<br>
        Inscribe our names, or quite obliterate!
      </p>

      <h2>CVII</h2>

      <p>
        Better, oh better, cancel from the Scroll<br>
        Of Universe one luckless Human Soul,<br>
            Than drop by drop enlarge the Flood that rolls<br>
        Hoarser with Anguish as the Ages roll.
      </p>

      <h2>CVIII</h2>

      <p>
        Ah Love! could you and I with Fate conspire<br>
        To grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire,<br>
            Would not we shatter it to bits—and then<br>
        Re-mould it nearer to the Heart’s Desire!
      </p>

      <h2>CIX</h2>

      <p>
        But see! The rising Moon of Heav’n again<br>
        Looks for us, Sweet-heart, through the quivering Plane:<br>
            How oft hereafter rising will she look<br>
        Among those leaves—for one of us in vain!
      </p>

      <h2>CX</h2>

      <p>
        And when Yourself with silver Foot shall pass<br>
        Among the Guests Star-scatter’d on the Grass,<br>
            And in your joyous errand reach the spot<br>
        Where I made One—turn down an empty Glass!
