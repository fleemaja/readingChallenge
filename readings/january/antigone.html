      <p>
        Creon, King of Thebes <br>
        Hæmon, son of Creon<br>
        Teiresias, a seer<br>
        Guard<br>
        First Messenger<br>
        Second Messenger<br>
        Eurydice, wife of Creon<br>

        Chorus of Theban Elders
      </p>

      <p>
        SCENE—Thebes, in front of the Palace.
      </p>

      <p>
        Enter ANTIGONE and ISMENE
      </p>

      <p>
        ANTIGONE  ISMENE, mine own sister, dearest one;<br>
        Is there, of all the ills of Œdipus,<br>
        One left that Zeus will fail to bring on us,<br>
        While still we live? for nothing is there sad<br>
        Or full of woe, or base, or fraught with shame,<br>
        But I have seen it in thy woes and mine.<br>
        And now, what new decree is this they tell,<br>
        Our ruler has enjoined on all the state?<br>
        Know’st thou? hast heard? or is it hid from thee,<br>
        The doom of foes that comes upon thy friends?
      </p>

      <p>
        ISM.  No tidings of our friends, Antigone,<br>
        Painful or pleasant since that hour have come<br>
        When we, two sisters, lost our brothers twain,<br>
        In one day dying by each other’s hand.<br>
        And since in this last night the Argive host<br>
        Has left the field, I nothing further know,<br>
        Nor brightening fortune, nor increasing gloom.
      </p>

      <p>
        ANTIG.  That knew I well, and therefore sent for thee<br>
        Beyond the gates, that thou mayst hear alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        ISM.  What meanest thou? It is but all to clear<br>
        Thou broodest darkly o’er some tale of woe.
      </p>

      <p>
        ANTIG.  And does not Creon treat our brothers twain<br>
        One with the rites of burial, one with shame?<br>
        Eteocles, so say they, he interred<br>
        Fitly, with wonted rites, as one held meet<br>
        To pass with honour to the gloom below.<br>
        But for the corpse of Polynices, slain<br>
        So piteously, they say, he has proclaimed<br>
        To all the citizens, that none should give<br>
        His body burial, or bewail his fate,<br>
        But leave it still unsepulchred, unwept,<br>
        A prize full rich for birds that scent afar<br>
        Their sweet repast. So Creon bids, they say,<br>
        Creon the good, commanding thee and me,<br>
        Yes, me, I say, and now is coming here,<br>
        To make it clear to those who knew it not,<br>
        And counts the matter not a trivial thing;<br>
        But whoso does the things that he forbids,<br>
        For him, there waits within the city’s walls<br>
        The death of stoning. Thus, then, stands thy case;<br>
        And quickly thou wilt show, if thou art born<br>
        Of noble nature, or degenerate liv’st,<br>
        Base child of honoured parents.
      </p>

      <p>
        ISM.  How could I,<br>
        O daring in thy mood, in this our plight,<br>
        Or doing or undoing, aught avail?
      </p>

      <p>
        ANTIG.  Wilt thou with me share risk and toil? Look to it.
      </p>

      <p>
        ISM.  What risk is this? What purpose fills thy mind?
      </p>

      <p>
        ANTIG.  Wilt thou with me go forth to help the dead?
      </p>

      <p>
        ISM.  And dost thou mean to give him sepulture,<br>
        When all have been forbidden?
      </p>

      <p>
        ANTIG.  He is still<br>
        My brother; yes, and thine, though thou, it seems,<br>
        Wouldst fain he were not. I desert him not.
      </p>

      <p>
        ISM.  O daring one, when Creon bids thee not!
      </p>

      <p>
        ANTIG.  What right has he to keep me from mine own?
      </p>

      <p>
        ISM.  Ah me! remember, sister, how our sire<br>
        Perished, with hate o’erwhelmed and infamy,<br>
        From evils that he brought upon himself,<br>
        And with his own hand robbed himself of sight,<br>
        And how his wife and mother, both in one,<br>
        With twist and cordage, cast away her life;<br>
        And thirdly, how our brothers in one day<br>
        In suicidal conflict wrought the doom,<br>
        Each of the other. And we twain are left;<br>
        And think, how much more wretchedly than all<br>
        We twain shall perish, if, against the law,<br>
        We brave our sovereign’s edict and his power.<br>
        For this we need remember, we were born<br>
        Women; as such, not made to strive with men.<br>
        And next, that they who reign surpass in strength,<br>
        And we must bow to this, and worse than this.<br>
        I, then, entreating those that dwell below,<br>
        To judge me leniently, as forced to yield,<br>
        Will hearken to our rulers. Over-zeal<br>
        In act or word but little wisdom shows.
      </p>

      <p>
        ANTIG.  I would not ask thee. No! if thou shouldst wish<br>
        To do it, and wouldst gladly join with me.<br>
        Do what thou wilt, I go to bury him;<br>
        And good it were, this having done, to die.<br>
        Loved I shall be with him whom I have loved,<br>
        Guilty of holiest crime. More time have I<br>
        In which to win the favour of the dead,<br>
        Than that of those who live; for I shall rest<br>
        For ever there. But thou, if thus thou please,<br>
        Count as dishonoured what the Gods approve.
      </p>

      <p>
        ISM.  I do them no dishonour, but I find<br>
        Myself too weak to war against the state.
      </p>

      <p>
        ANTIG.  Make what excuse thou wilt, I go to rear<br>
        A grave above the brother whom I love.
      </p>

      <p>
        ISM.  Ah, wretched me! how much I fear for thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        ANTIG.  Fear not for me. Thine own fate guide aright.
      </p>

      <p>
        ISM.  At any rate, disclose this deed to none:<br>
        Keep it close hidden. I will hide it too.
      </p>

      <p>
        ANTIG.  Speak out! I bid thee. Silent, thou wilt be<br>
        More hateful to me than if thou shouldst tell<br>
        My deed to all men.
      </p>

      <p>
        ISM.  Fiery is thy mood,<br>
        Although thy deeds might chill the very blood.
      </p>

      <p>
        ANTIG.  I know I please the souls I seek to please.
      </p>

      <p>
        ISM.  If thou canst do it; but thy passion craves<br>
        For things impossible.
      </p>

      <p>
        ANTIG.  I’ll cease to strive<br>
        When strength shall fail me.
      </p>

      <p>
        ISM.  Even from the first,<br>
        It is not meet to seek what may not be.
      </p>

      <p>
        ANTIG.  If thou speak thus, my hatred wilt thou gain,<br>
        And rightly wilt be hated of the dead.<br>
        Leave me and my ill counsel to endure<br>
        This dreadful doom. I shall not suffer aught<br>
        So evil as a death dishonourable.
      </p>

      <p>
        ISM.  Go, then, if so thou wilt. Of this be sure,<br>
        Wild as thou art, thy friends must love thee still.  [Exeunt.]
      </p>

        Enter Chorus
      </p>

        STROPH. I
      </p>

      <p>
        Chor.  Ray of the glorious sun,<br>
        Brightest of all that ever shone on Thebes,<br>
        Thebes with her seven high gates,<br>
        Thou didst appear that day,<br>
          Eye of the golden dawn,<br>
        O’er Dirkè’s streams advancing,<br>
        Driving with quickened curb,<br>
        In haste of headlong flight,<br>
        The warrior who, in panoply of proof,<br>
        From Argos came, with shield as white as snow;<br>
          Who came to this our land,<br>
        Roused by the strife of tongues<br>
        That Polynices stirred;<br>
        Shrieking his shrill sharp cry,<br>
          The eagle hovered round,<br>
        With snow-white wing bedecked,<br>
          Begirt with myriad arms,<br>
        And flowing horsehair crests.
      </p>

        ANTISTROPH. I
      </p>

      <p>
        He stood above our towers,<br>
      Circling, with blood-stained spears,<br>
        The portals of our gates;<br>
      He went, before he filled<br>
        His jaws with blood of men,<br>
      Before Hephæstus with his pitchy flame<br>
      Had seized our crown of towers.<br>
        So loud the battle din that Ares loves,<br>
      Was raised around his rear,<br>
      A conflict hard and stiff,<br>
      E’en for his dragon foe.<br>
      For breath of haughty speech<br>
      Zeus hateth evermore exceedingly;<br>
      And seeing them advance,<br>
      Exulting in the clang of golden arms,<br>
      With brandished fire he hurls them headlong down,<br>
      In act, upon the topmost battlement<br>
        Rushing, with eager step,<br>
      To shout out, ‘Victory!’
      </p>

      <p>
        STROPH. II
      </p>

      <p>
        Crashing to earth he fell,<br>
        Who came, with madman’s haste,<br>
        Drunken, but not with wine,<br>
        And swept o’er us with blasts,<br>
        The whirlwind blasts of hate.<br>
        Thus on one side they fare,<br>
        And mighty Ares, bounding in his strength,<br>
          Dashing now here, now there,<br>
          Elsewhere brought other fate.<br>
        For seven chief warriors at the seven gates met,<br>
          Equals with equals matched,<br>
        To Zeus, the Lord of War,<br>
        Left tribute, arms of bronze;<br>
        All but the hateful ones<br>
        Who, from one father and one mother sprung,<br>
        Stood wielding, hand to hand,<br>
        Their doubly pointed spears;<br>
        They had their doom of death,<br>
        In common, shared by both.
      </p>

      <p>
        ANTISTROPH. II
      </p>

      <p>
        But now, since Victory, of mightiest name,<br>
        Hath come to Thebes, of many chariots proud,<br>
          Joying and giving joy,<br>
        After these wars just past,<br>
          Learn ye forgetfulness,<br>
        And all night long, with dance and voice of hymns<br>
        Let us go round to all the shrines of Gods,<br>
        While Bacchus, making Thebes resound with shouts,<br>
          Begins the strain of joy;<br>
        But, lo! the sovereign of this land of ours,<br>
        CREON, Menœkeus’ son,<br>
        He, whom strange change and chances from the God<br>
          Have nobly raised to power,<br>
        Comes to us, steering on some new device;<br>
        For, lo! he hath convened,<br>
          By herald’s loud command,<br>
        This council of the elders of our land.
      </p>

      <p>
        Enter CREON
      </p>

      <p>
        CREON.  My Friends, for what concerns our commonwealth,<br>
        The Gods who vexed it with the billowing storms<br>
        Have righted it again; but I have sent,<br>
        By special summons, calling you to come<br>
        Apart from all the others, This, in part,<br>
        As knowing ye did all along uphold<br>
        The might of Laius’ throne, in part again,<br>
        Because when Œdipus our country ruled,<br>
        And, when he perished, then towards his sons<br>
        Ye still were faithful in your steadfast mind.<br>
        And since they fell, as by a double death,<br>
        Both on the selfsame day with murderous blow,<br>
        Smiting and being smitten, now I hold<br>
        Their thrones and all their power of sov’reignty<br>
        By nearness of my kindred to the dead.<br>
        And hard it is to learn what each man is,<br>
        In heart and mind and judgment, till one gains<br>
        Experience in the exercise of power.<br>
        For me, whoe’er is called to guide a state,<br>
        And does not catch at counsels wise and good,<br>
        But holds his peace through any fear of man,<br>
        I deem him basest of all men that are,<br>
        Of all that ever have been; and whoe’er<br>
        As worthier than his country counts his friend,<br>
        I utterly despise him. I myself,<br>
        Zeus be my witness, who beholdeth all,<br>
        Will not keep silence, seeing danger come,<br>
        Instead of safety, to my subjects true.<br>
        Nor could I take as friend my country’s foe;<br>
        For this I know, that there our safety lies,<br>
        And sailing in her while she holds her course,<br>
        We gather friends around us. By these rules<br>
        And such as these will I maintain the state.<br>
        And now I come, with edicts close allied<br>
        To these in spirit, for my subjects all,<br>
        Concerning those two sons of Œdipus.<br>
        Eteocles, who died in deeds of might<br>
        Illustrious, fighting for our fatherland,<br>
        To honour him with sepulture, all rites<br>
        Duly performed that to the noblest dead<br>
        Of right belong. Not so his brother; him<br>
        I speak of, Polynices, who, returned<br>
        From exile, sought with fire and sword to waste<br>
        His father’s city and the shrines of Gods,<br>
        Yea, sought to glut his rage with blood of men,<br>
        And lead them captives to the bondslave’s doom;<br>
        Him I decree that none should dare entomb,<br>
        That none should utter wail or loud lament,<br>
        But leave his corpse unburied, by the dogs<br>
        And vultures mangled, foul to look upon.<br>
        Such is my purpose. Ne’er, if I can help,<br>
        Shall the vile share the honours of the just;<br>
        But whoso shows himself my country’s friend,<br>
        Living or dead, from me shall honour gain.
      </p>

      <p>
        Chor.  This is thy pleasure, O Menœkeus’ son,<br>
        For him who hated, him who loved our state;<br>
        And thou hast power to make what laws thou wilt,<br>
        Both for the dead and all of us who live.
      </p>

      <p>
        CREON.  Be ye, then, guardians of the things I speak.
      </p>

      <p>
        Chor.  Commit this task to one of younger years.
      </p>

      <p>
        CREON.  The watchmen are appointed for the corpse.
      </p>

      <p>
        Chor.  What duty, then, enjoin’st thou on another?
      </p>

      <p>
        CREON.  Not to consent with those that disobey.
      </p>

      <p>
        Chor.  None are so foolish as to seek for death.
      </p>

      <p>
        CREON.  And that shall be his doom; but love of gain<br>
        Hath oft with false hopes lured men to their death.
      </p>

      <p>
        Enter Guard
      </p>

      <p>
        GUARD.  I will not say, O king, that I am come<br>
        Panting with speed and plying nimble feet,<br>
        For I had many halting-points of thought,<br>
        Backwards and forwards turning, round and round;<br>
        For now my mind would give me sage advice:<br>
        “Poor wretch, and wilt thou go and bear the blame?”<br>
        Or—“Dost thou tarry now? Shall Creon know<br>
        These things from others? How wilt thou escape?”<br>
        Resolving thus, I came in haste, yet slow,<br>
        And thus a short way finds itself prolonged,<br>
        But, last of all, to come to thee prevailed.<br>
        And though I tell of naught, thou shalt hear all;<br>
        For this one hope I cling to steadfastly,<br>
        That I shall suffer nothing but my fate.
      </p>

      <p>
        CREON.  What is it, then, that causes such dismay?
      </p>

      <p>
        GUARD.  First, for mine own share in it, this I say,<br>
        I did not do it, do not know who did,<br>
        Nor should I rightly come to ill for it.
      </p>

      <p>
        CREON.  Thou tak’st good aim and fencest up thy tale<br>
        All round and round. ’Twould seem thou hast some news.
      </p>

      <p>
        GUARD.  Yea, news of fear engenders long delay.
      </p>

      <p>
        CREON.  Tell thou thy tale, and then depart in peace.
      </p>

      <p>
        GUARD.  And speak I will. The corpse … Some one has been<br>
        But now and buried it, a little dust<br>
        O’er the skin scattering, with the wonted rites.
      </p>

      <p>
        CREON.  What say’st thou? Who has dared this deed of guilt?
      </p>

      <p>
        GUARD.  I know not. Neither was there stroke of spade,<br>
        Nor earth cast up by mattock. All the soil<br>
        Was dry and hard, no track of chariot wheel;<br>
        But he who did it went and left no sign.<br>
        But when the first day’s watchman showed it us,<br>
        The sight caused wonder and sore grief to all,<br>
        For he had disappeared. No tomb, indeed,<br>
        Was over him, but dust all lightly strown,<br>
        As by some hand that shunned defiling guilt;<br>
        And no work was there of a beast of prey<br>
        Or dog devouring. Evil words arose<br>
        Among us, guard to guard imputing blame,<br>
        Which might have come to blows, for none was there<br>
        To check its course, and each to each appeared<br>
        The man whose hand had done it. As for proof,<br>
        That there was none, and so he ’scaped our ken.<br>
        And we were ready in our hands to take<br>
        Bars of hot iron, and to walk through fire,<br>
        And call the Gods to witness none of us<br>
        Had done the deed, nor knew who counselled it,<br>
        Nor who had wrought it. Then at last, when naught<br>
        Was gained by all our searching, some one says<br>
        What made us bend our gaze upon the ground<br>
        In fear and trembling; for we neither saw<br>
        How to oppose it, nor, accepting it,<br>
        How we might prosper in it. And his speech<br>
        Was this, that all our tale should go to thee,<br>
        Not hushed up anywise. This gained the day;<br>
        And me, ill-starred, the lot condemns to win<br>
        This precious prize. So here I come to thee<br>
        Against my will; and surely do I trow<br>
        Thou dost not wish to see me. Still ’tis true<br>
        That no man loves the messenger of ill.
      </p>

      <p>
        Chor.  For me, my prince, my mind some time has thought<br>
        That this perchance has some divine intent.
      </p>

      <p>
        CREON.  Cease thou, before thou fillest me with wrath,<br>
        Lest thou be found a dastard and a fool.<br>
        For what thou say’st is most intolerable,<br>
        That for this corpse the providence of Gods<br>
        Has any care. What! have they buried him,<br>
        As to their patron paying honours high,<br>
        Who came to waste their columned shrines with fire,<br>
        To desecrate their offerings and their lands,<br>
        And all their wonted customs? Dost thou see<br>
        The Gods approving men of evil deeds?<br>
        It is not so; but men of rebel mood,<br>
        Lifting their head in secret long ago,<br>
        Have stirred this thing against me. Never yet<br>
        Had they their neck beneath the yoke, content<br>
        To own me as their ruler. They, I know,<br>
        Have bribed these men to let the deed be done.<br>
        No thing in use by man, for power of ill,<br>
        Can equal money. This lays cities low,<br>
        This drives men forth from quiet dwelling-place,<br>
        This warps and changes minds of worthiest stamp,<br>
        To turn to deeds of baseness, teaching men<br>
        All shifts of cunning, and to know the guilt<br>
        Of every impious deed. But they who, hired,<br>
        Have wrought this crime, have laboured to their cost,<br>
        Or soon or late to pay the penalty.<br>
        But if Zeus still claims any awe from me,<br>
        Know this, and with an oath I tell it thee,<br>
        Unless ye find the very man whose hand<br>
        Has wrought this burial, and before mine eyes<br>
        Present him captive, death shall not suffice,<br>
        Till first, impaled still living, ye shall show<br>
        The story of this outrage, that henceforth,<br>
        Knowing what gain is lawful, ye may grasp<br>
        At that, and learn it is not meet to love<br>
        Gain from all quarters. By base profit won,<br>
        You will see more destroyed than prospering.
      </p>

      <p>
        GUARD.  May I, then speak? Or shall I turn and go?
      </p>

      <p>
        CREON.  Dost thou not see how vexing are thy words?
      </p>

      <p>
        GUARD.  Is it thine ears they trouble, or thy soul?
      </p>

      <p>
        CREON.  Why dost thou gauge my trouble where it is?
      </p>

      <p>
        GUARD.  The doer grieves thy heart, but I thine ears.
      </p>

      <p>
        CREON.  Pshaw! what a babbler, born to prate, art thou.
      </p>

      <p>
        GUARD.  And therefore not the man to do this deed.
      </p>

      <p>
        CREON.  Yes, that too; selling e’en thy soul for pay.
      </p>

      <p>
        GUARD.  Ah me!<br>
        How fearful ’tis, in thinking, false to think.
      </p>

      <p>
        CREON.  Prate about thinking; but unless ye show<br>
        To me the doers, ye shall say ere long<br>
        That evil gains still work their punishment.  [Exit.]
      </p>

      <p>
        GUARD.  God send we find him! Should we find him not,<br>
        As well may be, for this must chance decide,<br>
        You will not see me coming here again;<br>
        For now, being safe beyond all hope of mine,<br>
        Beyond all thought, I owe the Gods much thanks.  [Exit]
